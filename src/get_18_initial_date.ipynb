If you have not read the earlier works please do not read.\\n\\nLike all BDB fans, I was eagerly awaiting this installment.  During my first reading I was not a great fan of Rhage and Mary and thought the ending of their romance was a bit of a cheat, not as much as Vishous\\' and Jane\\'s but still a cheat.  However, I got over it and during my second reading, I found more to like.  I still didn\\'t like the ending, but I\\'m not the writer.\\n\\nIn this Rhage & Mary part deux, it didn\\'t feel as if J. R. Ward was the writer of this one.\\n\\nI have read the entire series twice and even the books that I gave less than a three rating to felt an integral part of the series and contained a lot of information that pushed the story forward.  This novel felt like an elongated novella, as if the writer started with the idea of writing something similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Father-Mine-Zsadist-and-Bella-s-Story-A-Black-Dagger-Brotherhood-Novella/dp/B001HQHCBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Father Mine: Zsadist and Bella\\'s Story: A Black Dagger Brotherhood Novella</a>.  IF, this had been done as a novella, I might have been able to get over my issues, however, it wasn\\'t, and I haven\\'t.\\n\\nMy number one issue is the time of this story.  It happened too, way too, quickly.  All of this happens in basically a week, start to finish a week.  A young girl\\'s mother dies and within a week a new family is formed.  While I understand that under normal circumstances a foster family would have been found, the \"family\" building happened too quickly to be palatable.  In addition, it seemed like the first third of the book dealt only with the first night.  It just seemed to be a Perfect Storm where too many things were happening in just one night. Bouncing between all of them just became irritating as I just wanted to get through the night.  I had assumed (I know, I know) that this book would take place over months given all of the minor story arcs, but no, the first night takes forever and the rest of the week is a slam bam thank you ma\\'am.\\n\\nAnother issue was this story was depressing.  All encompassing depressing.  There should have been at least one portion of this story that didn\\'t leave me feeling in need of some medication.  While there were some hot sexy scenes, they felt forced and as if they were supposed to make all of the other melodrama OK.\\n\\nNormally, I like the side stories included in the novels, even the ones of the humans that we will never meet again, like the ones that interacted with Murhder.  However, this time, the human story took forever to get to its point.  None of the humans made me care about them, they did not inspire me.\\n\\nAssail is back and just as addicted as before, he is helping the King, and he is on the edge.  Reading over and over how he is doing cocaine and his nose running kept pulling me out of the story.  Not since Phury and his addiction have I wanted to just stomp on a character.\\n\\nLayla is also has a major side story and I am so tired of her not telling anyone what they need to know.  While I understood Autumn (No\\'One) being a wimp, I find Layla\\'s wimpyness to be selfish and unloyal, which is probably its purpose, but the further the story goes the less I like her.\\n\\nOmega and The Scribe Virgin, well the less I say about them the better.  In the beginning of the series both started off with such strong characters and now they are just walk on parts.\\n\\nWhich brings me back to the fact that all of these major story arcs are happening in a week\\'s time, when they should have been happening over months.  Which again makes me wonder if this story was supposed to be a novella and yet all this other information needed to come into play.  It is sad that so many of us count the days, weeks and months for our next installment of  \"As the Sun Sets: Lives and Loves of the Caldwell Vampires\" and instead of getting a rich full bodied story, we get scraps of stories sewn together in a depressing mess.\\n\\nIf you are going to continue reading the series, like I am, you need to read this.  It won\\'t be the best in the series, but then it\\'s also not the worst.'),\n",

       "   'Once again, an author saves the best in their series for last. Tamera Alexander\\'s A Note Yet Unsung, the final in the Belmont Mansion series, is a triumph.\\n\\nRebekah Carrington plays the violin in an era when women\\'s musical talents were confined to the piano, and perhaps woodwinds. Even worse, she dreams of playing in an orchestra in an era when it is unthinkable for women to do so. As if her gender wasn\\'t enough of a strike against her, Rebekah has also lost her beloved father and been the victim of family molestation thanks to her letch of a stepfather. Yet she doesn\\'t act bitter or give up. Faced with the prospect of living under her childhood roof again with the aforementioned stepfather and an ineffectual mother, Rebekah goes out on a limb to net what she assumes is a governess position. Instead, she\\'s assigned to teach Adelicia Cheatham\\'s daughter to play the violin, and ends up as assistant to Maestro Tate Whitcomb. The problem is, Tate is also the man who originally shot down Rebekah\\'s dream of playing in the Nashville Philharmonic.\\n\\nOf course, Tate didn\\'t mean to hurt Rebekah. He was just going along with convention, which he feels he must do to keep his job. It\\'s a prestigious position and one he can\\'t afford to lose, especially since his body is betraying him and his family needs the money. On the outside, this man is cold, exacting, unreasonable, and a downright pain in the butt. Yet as readers and Rebekah discover, that icy exterior hides a warm, tender heart and deep faith. The relationship between Rebekah and Tate is one of the best I\\'ve seen recently. The two kind of remind me of Beauty and the Beast, especially when Rebekah stands up to Tate and gets him to control his temper.\\n\\nAs mentioned, Rebekah is a cheer-worthy heroine well ahead of her time. Her musical gifts are astounding, but her character is even more so. Every scene she stars in stands out, but I recommend spending extra time on a few favorites. The one in which she goes after Tate to discover his secrets is a great one, showing her spunk. Her tenderness comes through during a scene where she helps Adelicia fight neuralgia.\\n\\nA good author knows how to create secondary characters, and Tamera Alexander is a pro at this. Delphia and Demetrius are superb, and Nana\\'s inner beauty shines through even from beyond the grave. Barton Ledbetter is a delicious villain, and Darrow Fulton is a prime example of a whiny bully who never grew up (if you ask me, Rebekah let him off too easy). Of course, Tate\\'s family is a wonderful ensemble as well, especially his dad Angus.\\n\\nThere are a few odd \"notes\" in this symphony of a book. For example, there\\'s a lot of suspense built up around what Barton Ledbetter is doing traveling all over the country, but it\\'s never fully explained what he\\'s doing. He is eventually brought to justice, but almost in a deus ex machina way. There is also a subplot with a street kid named Billy, which is inexplicably left hanging. As a personal preference, I\\'d have liked to know more about what happened to Tate after he gave his final triumphant symphony. Overall though, this was a wonderful end to the Belmont Mansion series that I highly recommend.'),\n",

Even though Diane Capri's 'Hunt for Reacher' books deal with two FBI agents on a 'search for Reacher' for a purpose they have not been let in on yet, even getting to read about someone looking for him is enough to make me read these books. And the books are always good, so I score every time. The two agents, Kim Otto and Carlos Gaspar, have been thrown together to hunt for Jack Reacher by a man they aren't sure if they really trust, but continue the search. Despite the Intel they receive from the 'boss', they always seem to be a step behind or have their backs turned when Reacher slides in and then disappears again before they realize it. The logistics of this book, which takes up where one of Lee Childs books leaves off (with Childs blessing) are mind-boggling and keep your eyes moving to page after page after page. I actually thought there was a hint of interplay between Reacher and another character early on the book, but you second guess yourself if it was really him and I decided it wasn't when this character helped kill off someone else. Reacher's all about keeping people alive - at least the ones he feels need to be kept alive. Otto and Gaspar wind up with two other 'partners' named Branch and Villanova who join the search as they are looking for one of the same people Otto and Gaspar are trying to find to get some answers. These were new characters, but I hope to read more about them. I don't want to write any spoilers, but Reacher is in Maine to protect two of his friends. Because that's Reacher. He most definitely appears towards the end of the book, although you only see the results of his work at Abbot Cape House outside of Portland, Maine. The four searchers go into an almost impossible situation, in the middle of a blizzard, and do the best they can do, which is just good enough. Good writing, good story line that keeps you moving along, thrills and chills (especially in the blizzard!) - I give this book 4.5 stars. Read it.\"),\n",

       "   'This is a rather hard book to review, and my rating reflects my expectations. Harold Davis has a long history of producing excellent images and worthy book; I have several. The first half of the book is devoted to the idea of Black & White; B&W vs Color, Visualization in B&W, esthetics of B&W. There are many of the author\\'s images; so many that they do tend to dominate the reading experience. Many were in fact inspirational to me.\\n\\nThe Amazon product page suggests \"definitive\" information on B&W photography, and I quote \" How to see in black and white  Pre-visualization in digital photography  Understanding black and white composition  How to create your own black and white workflow  Black and white in ACR, Lightroom, and Photoshop  Using black and white plug-ins including Nik Silver Efex Pro and Topaz B&W Effects  Extending tonal range with multi-RAW processing and monochromatic HDR  Post-production techniques for working with dynamic range  Creative black and white special effects  Find out how to tone, tint, colorize, solarize, and simulate IR  Work with LAB to create unique black and white effects  Great tools for unleashing your photographic imagination. This list is copied from the inside front cover. Sounds like you\\'re going to learn a lot about the software and the workflow, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\nBut sadly, you do not. Yes each piece of software is mentioned, and there are a few screen shots, but little on actually using the software. If you\\'ve read anywhere that NIK Silver Efex Pro produces B&W images, you already know what this book will tell you. Same for Topaz. Same for Lightroom. The same paucity of detail applies to sections on creating HDR sets. The software is mentioned, but no details beyond suggestions that you play with the sliders. Adobe Camera Raw gets the bulk of the action, as does Photoshop, especially layers and masks. This is good; layers, masks and the soft brush are considered some of the ground breaking tools of Photoshop. But there are books on Layers that provide far more information.\\n\\nWorkflow is an important aspect of using Photoshop, and a non-destructive workflow in the ideal approach. The outline provided is fine, but the examples are frequently destructive, including making several adjustment layers and then flattening the image before taking the next steps. In one example, these multiple steps are preserved by making sequential saves of intermediate versions... i.e. files named HLD0148, HLD0148a, HLD0148b. If you did not read the screenshot captions, you would not have realized these are indeed individually saved files. It\\'s not clearly stated. Back in the day, this was the only path to a non-destructive workflow. Go back to earlier images of you later need to take a different path.\\n\\nOn a normal image layer, NIK produces it\\'s output on a new image layer that does not save NIK settings and must be recreated from scratch if changes needed. Entirely missing is the use of smart objects, especially as they allow re-editing even of RAW images. The NIK utilities work just fine on smart objects and allow re-editing using the saved slider positions. Multiple NIK filters can be applied to the same smart object and individually re-edited if necessary. New smart objects can be created from existing smart objects, so I believe virtually all the many steps shown in this book\\'s examples can be contained in a single Photoshop document and remain fully editable.  (I am unfamiliar with Topaz and cannot speak to its compatibility with smart objects. But NIK is now free and it is smart object friendly.)\\n\\nSo it seems that the author is presenting techniques that reflect old versions of Photoshop and has not kept up with the enhancements of the newer versions. That said, it is completely true that these techniques work. The essence of the workflow is to consider various photographic aspects of an image, foreground/background, highlights/shadows, and apply adjustments to each as needed, using masks to isolate these separate adjustments. The author\\'s work is excellent and a lot can be learned from this book.'),\n",

       "   \"Bonnye Matthews writes imaginative stories about ancient peoples, based on archaeological discoveries around the world.  In Freedom, 250,000 B.C.: Out from the Shadow of Popocatepetl, Matthews tells the story of Wing, who lived in what is now Mexico more than 250,000 years ago.  That date is quite controversial.  Years ago some bones with carvings on them were uncovered in this area.  Carbon dating placed their age at 250,000 years, which is tens of thousands of years before other scientists believed humans had come to this hemisphere.  Needless to say, the finding was controversial, contested, and may have been a fraud.\\n\\nMatthews believes the date is accurate, and has created Wing's story set in that era.  Wing and his people are primitive hunter-gatherers, but practice some medicine, have permanent homes, use weapons such as spears and knives, and build boats.  Sixteen year old Wing tires of his father's verbal and physical abuse and sets out on his own.  After a lengthy journey, he settles in with relatives who accept him as one of their own.  He marries, has children, and eventually returns for a visit to his home village.\\n\\nObviously the story is purely fictional, but it's fun to imagine these primitive people raising families, passing along parental wisdom, exploring their world, and even having self-reflective revelations.  They weren't that different from you and me.  Matthews even envisions different animal life.  Camels and lions live in Mexico at this time, and Wing and his family have close encounters with enormous alligators and terror birds (which thanks to Wikipedia I now know are a real thing.  They were called Phorusrhacidae and sound pretty terrifying).  I like the way Matthews weaves geological, paleontological, and anthropological history into a story with adventure, romance, and spiritual enlightenment.\\n\\nThanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!\"),\n",

Now, there were some hot and steamy parts and some hot (think a pissed hot) parts as they both have to deal with their past.

       "   \"I was turned on to this by reading the new Hook Jaw series that started in late 2016 and found out it was based on a banned comic called Action Comic from the U.K. in the 1970's. It is a product of it's time and the stories are usually 4 pages long and left with a cliff-hanger ending. I'm not sure why, but the first 2 pages of each story are colored and the final 2 black & white. It looks like the printing is either a little blurry on a few pages or it was reprinted from the original print and that's just how it was. If you look at the first 2 photos I've inserted, the first one shows the black character Sharkey and the coloring is fine. In the second photo, he is so dark you cannot see his features.  The last photo is a shot of the back cover. I enjoyed this. The stories are simple, straight to the point and geared for children. I'm glad I read it and if it was available in the U.S. when it was first printed, I would've purchased it. It's going for $26.12 today and that's a heck of a lot cheaper than the only other printing that's available. If you like older comics, you will probably like this or if you want to read a piece of banned comic history, check it out.\\n  FYI, the photos of the art for this book(with the exception of the book cover - first photo) included by Amazon are not from this book. The art represented is from the new Hook Jaw series which I enjoyed also.\"),\n",

       "   'Charming tale of less than one hundred pages focusing on the meanderings of a black mustang colt. As a young colt he loved to chase butterflies, playing with the other newborns. Traveling with the herd, he faced many dangers including attacks by a mountain lion and bear. One day he is separated from the herd. His travels will bring him across the lands of Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado and Oklahoma. The colt must face wildfires and hunters traps. One fateful day he is lassoed and brought to the barn of a ranch. A young girl named Paula tries to win his devotion, but he is afraid and that leads to being taken away once more. A kind rancher tries to tame him, but the mustang feels he must escape once more. An unexpected accident on the road leads to a chance meeting with Tyler that will change both of their lives forever.\\n\\nThis tale is written from the viewpoint of the black mustang. It is almost a stream of consciousness, while the plot moves along there is not a central thread. The author does an excellent job of securing empathy with the colt. Children who love or own horses will identify with the protagonist. The ending came as a surprise. I would love to see a sequel as I would love to see that story fleshed out. I would especially recommend the book to middle grade readers and teen audiences.'),\n",

However, the book held my interest throughout since I eagerly wanted to get to the answers. Some of the actions seemed improbable but do carry the story forward.

It was published by a small press I didn't know and written by an author I had never heard of, Andrew Hilbert. Death Thing looked like an interesting book, though, so I bought a copy and got into it. Am I ever glad I did. That book is a small masterpiece of neo-pulp absurdity. It's gruesome and funny and smart, a sly meditation on post-Reagan America and, I think, a prescient swipe at the culture that has since promoted Donald Trump to a serious contender for the presidency.\\n\\nDon't misunderstand. Death Thing isn't overtly political. It's the story of a crazy man - think Archie Bunker's down on his luck, grossly imperfect, sociopathic third cousin - who turns his car into a lethal trap for the lowlifes who keep breaking into it and ripping him off. What he does, how he does it, and the world in which he operates skewer the America that has devolved through the decades from the awful Reagan legacy until now.\\n\\nBang Face is Hilbert's gut punch of a follow-up to Death Thing. His power is intact and pure in this new and practically indescribable psycho joy ride which follows the title character, a disfigured private eye, on a trek through slime and wonder. It has something to do with finding a wondrous glory hole, something to do with identity, everything to do with giving the reader a slog through the promised land of a culture on the skids. It's like a Sam Spade noir written by The Joker.\\n\\nIf you like Bukowski or Harry Crews, I think you're going to like Hilbert.

       "   'Wowow. Where to begin? Ive just finished The Girl Before and wanted to immediately run and write a review. It was just that good! It is a psychological thriller that has fallen into the category of the next Gone Girl! In this case, unlike The Girl in Cabin 10, The Woman Next Door, The Girl on the Train, etc. I feel the comparison is warranted.\\n\\nThe Girl Before is told from two viewpoints, from Emma and Jane. The story centers on One Folgate Street, a state of the art minimalist house that was designed by an eccentric architect named Edward Monkford.  The house has a lot of mystery surrounding it and if not for the stubbornness of the architect, it may have never been built. In order to move in, the tenant must sign off on and follow a list of over 200 rules, take a personality test, and interview with the architect himself.  If you\\'re able to suspend your disbelief, then this part of the plot works.\\n\\nEmma is categorized as Then and Jane is the \"Now\". I thought the author did a nice job juxtaposing the two stories. You quickly find out that something terrible has happened to Emma, which is why Jane has the ability to move in in the first place. The stories are eerily similar. Both women have recently experienced trauma. Both have an immediate connection with the architect. Both start to fall under the spell of the home and subtly start to change. Then.... the stories diverge. As Emma\\'s story unfolds, Jane uncovers clues that hint that something isn\\'t quite right about this house, and I was racing through the chapters to figure out what actually went down. This book had me like NO!! THE CALL IS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE! DONT OPEN THE DOOR! for parts of it. There was a definite creep factor.\\n\\nSome of the criticism Ive read so far from this book is from people wondering who would ever sign up for such strict criteria. To me, the story is plausible. Hell, rent is expensive.. More importantly, both women have recently had tragedies occur in their lives that would break anyone. People make a lot of extreme decisions when faced with tragedy, and we find out the two women don\\'t necessarily make the best decisions in the first place.\\n\\nMy recommendation for this book comes with definite trigger warnings. I don\\'t want to spoil too much of the plot, but right from the first few chapters I had to take a break. The description of what the characters were going through was so vivid, and after finishing the book and reading the authors note, it seems like the author has a personal connection to Janes story. The sadness she felt was especially palpable because of the authentic descriptions. Jane eventually finds herself becoming obsessed with figuring out what happened to Emma, and I have to say I was surprised by the ending. Not so much by the end of the Emma chapters, but definitely by Jane\\'s.\\n\\nThere is a 50 Shades feel to some of the parts that I could have done without. I started off liking both of the women, but by the end I was totally over one of them (it won\\'t be hard to figure out who). In addition to everything else, there were a ton of moral dilemmas- medical malpractice, allegations of sexual abuse, abortion- but in the end all of the story becomes unpacked. It was very well written, especially from Janes perspective. There was a bit of an ambiguous ending that shocked me, but I still walked away feeling satisfied.\\n\\nFun fact- The Girl Before is going to be made into a movie directed by Ron Howard. I cant wait to see what they do with the house! I picture Edward as Jude Law and Emily Blunt as Jane. I really hope they go more creepy, psychological thriller than 50 shades. Either way, get your hands on this book ASAP.'),\n",

       "   \"Do you like to read books that may take a short time to warm up, but then when they do, things take off at a breathtaking pace? Or how about books that are intricately plotted with a cast of well drawn, realistic characters? What about books that skim the boundaries of genre labels and just do their own thing? If you found yourself nodding along while reading that, then I have the book for you!\\n\\nStories that focus on the aftermath following an abduction are always quick to draw my attention and though this started off a tiny bit slow, I was still hooked rather quickly. The beginning focuses on Livia as shes completing her residency in pathology and there is quite a bit of medical jargon used, but that type of thing interests me and Livias POV was a new one for me. It uses an alternating timeline from the weeks leading up to the abduction and then over a year after Megan escapes and Nicole is still missing. The chapters are short and extremely fast paced and as things flip back and forth, you slowly but surely find out what happened. Nicoles flashbacks have crossover appeal as they had a YA feel to them, adding to the realistic writing throughout.\\n\\nThere were a lot of hints dropped that mislead me and in no way did I have it all figured out, Donlea didn't take the easy way out by going with the obvious answers, he executed some killer twists that left me gasping. I think this is one that will fool even the craftiest of readers, multiple times. At times it was dark as it explored some sick, odd obsessions but that made it all the more of a compulsive read for me. I also really liked the chapters where Megan was doing hypnotherapy sessions as its a subject that intrigues me. This was a fantastic, solid mystery that delivered on all levels.\"),\n",

Living there her whole life, she was raised as an heiress to the Bottling factory her father owned that employed most of the townspeople. That was never what she wanted to be though, she just wanted to be Catherine and figure out what her purpose in life was supposed to be.\\n\\nChris Carmichael comes from humble beginnings, living on the wrong side of the fence. But to young Catherine, he is everything she could ever want or need. Society (her mother) will do everything to keep them apart, though, because he has no money and isn't good enough for her.\\n\\nI first met Catherine in King of Code, which is about her sister, Harper. If you haven't read that yet, no worries, C.D. blends those scenes seamlessly into this book and gives the reader Catherine's view of those interactions. Having read that book, the scenes we get in White Knight between Catherine and Harper are made all the more personal and special, I think.\\n\\nTold in alternating points of view of Catherine and Chris, C.D. takes us by the hand and leads us down a path into their past and how they met, fell in love, and were separated. Chris being convinced that he needed to leave Barrington and go make something of himself, make enough money to be worthy of Catherine. Now it's 13 years later, both have forged ahead in life but never found their way back to each other. Until Chris' dog passes away and he decides to take him back to Barrington to bury him with his siblings. Is this really just an excuse to go back and find Catherine again?\\n\\nC.D. does prose like no other author I've read. She nails the angst of young love, of teenagers who know what they want and how they feel, but those older and wiser are convinced them being together would be disastrous. In current time, she intricately describes the struggles that Catherine and Chris feel. Did they live the past 13 years the way they were supposed to? How different would their lives have turned out if they had just made the effort to find their way back to each other?\\n\\nA lot has happened in the 13 years apart. Catherine has become the backbone of Barrington, being there for everyone in the town, and they have been there for her as well. But is that what she was supposed to be doing? She loves helping everyone, but something has been missing from her life all these years. Chris succeeded in what he set out to do, earn enough money to be worthy of Catherine, but what has it cost him in the end?\\n\\nThis story is a beautifully crafted second chance romance. It begs the question of how their lives would have turned out if even one choice had been made differently. I so enjoyed experiencing the reconnection, the journey Catherine and Chris make to get to where they should have been 13 years ago. I wish we had seen more of that though. I felt like once Catherine decides she is willing to try with Chris, we just got glimpses of that journey together before the epilogue suddenly popped up. I am greedy in this respect, and to be honest, I as the reader needed more of the reasoning as to why Chris stayed away even after he had achieved his goal and made some of the life choices he did, even if Catherine didn't need them. I guess it's a good thing I have never been in a second chance situation in my life, because the poor guy would suffer miserably for a long time before I finally relented.\\n\\nI have really loved reading all of the books in the American Royalty universe. I hope everyone picks them up, I think you will really love them too!\"),\n",

       "   \"I've been a big fan of David Wong/Jason Pargin since the early days when John Dies at the End was posted on Pointless Waste of Time. He's earned the right to get a pre order from me any time he publishes a book, and I started this one literally the minute it came to my kindle. I can definitely say I was not disappointed, and I don't think long time fans of JDatE will be either.\\n\\nWhat the Hell Did I Just Read is a lot truer to the series than This Book is Full of Spiders, I think. I similarly read TBiFoS as soon as it was possible, but I finished reading initially with a bit of disappointment. My biggest problem with TBiFoS was what Pargin did with Amy and John as characters. In JDatE, Amy and John are both good characters to round out David. While David is a bit of a buzzkill, and reluctant to do anything or be the hero, John and Amy are there to drive forward the stupidity and give you something to cheer for. John was a great character in JDatE because not only does he go along with the insanity of what is happening to them, he seems to embrace it. Amy is good for similar reasons, but in a different way. While she is frequently a voice of reason, she also doesn't want David to shy away from what needs to be done, and she always wants to go along.\\n\\nHowever, in TBiFoS, both characters are given points of view, which they didn't previously have in JDatE. They're given significantly more depth, which generally is a good thing the deeper you go into a series, but I don't actually think they benefited from this in TBiFoS. The biggest problem I have is John in particular, instead of being the insane, stupid badass that he is in JDatE, he's made to look more like a raging alcoholic that doesn't have his life together and actually becomes a way less likable character. Don't get me wrong, he's definitely a drunken idiot that has serious issues in JDatE, but the lack of repercussions makes it a lot easier to look past. In TBiFoS, John lets Amy down multiple times, which mostly makes him very disappointing.\\n\\nMy other big issue with TBiFoS is that the story itself is a bit trite and overdone (it boils down to a zombie book, really, and there's too many zombie stories right now), despite JDatE being the first of its kind at the time and breathing some fresh air into the horror genre. The biggest thing JDatE had going for it was that one second you would be laughing uncontrollably and the next absolutely horrified. I never really had moments like that with TBiFoS, in fact there was very little in the book for me to laugh at.\\n\\nAll that being said, What the Hell Did I Just Read completely turned all that around. Within the first few chapters I was laughing way too hard, and the jokes were very true to JDatE at its roots. The story itself was much more reminiscent of the original story, without being the same thing all over again. And John and Amy were still given points of view, but I thought their characters were much better used in WtHDIJR, and John became a likable character again.\\n\\nMy big concerns with the book were that Amy was given an amount of depth that may be pushing too far for some fans. I found her concerns and issues in the book very reasonable and realistic, but I could see some fans starting to treat her like Skyler White, if anyone is familiar with Breaking Bad and the fan backlash against that character. It will be interesting to see how the fanbase reacts.\\n\\nMy other issue is that while the first half of the book was very page turning and engaging, the second half tended to drag. The climactic ending to the story seemed to start too early and last too long, which leads to disinterest. This is actually one of the biggest reasons I had trouble getting into Pargin's last book, Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits, but not something I noticed in his first two books. Hopefully this isn't the direction he finds himself going in with future books, and he learns to reign this in a little.\\n\\nOverall, though, this book is amazing. Very worth reading for any fans of JDatE, and definitely holds its own in the universe that was written. I'm excited to read it through again, maybe a little slower and get a feel for it more.\"),\n",

Considering Sara's opinion of David in the beginning I was totally surprised by the relationship that developed between them.  Not letting any more secrets out the story was well written and developed well with enough surprises to keep it interesting.  For those familiar with Dianna Palmer's books I found this to be in a similar style but with enough differences to be an original.\\nOverall an enjoyable read. 3.5-4 stars.\"),\n",

Surprising considering the first had more sex than I am strictly comfortable reading, especially considering that most, if not all sexual practices going on in the background (and in one case the foreground) of the first book were nonconsensual. But the sexual activity dropped considerably in the second and third books, and the majority of the novels were just as focused on political intrigue, clever twists, and planned machinations between characters as it was on the growing relationship between the two main characters. They constantly had me shocked and surprised. The chemistry between the main characters in the second two books is what really made this series for me. I enjoyed every interaction.

God, his POV is like looking through the eyes of a higher being. There is something heavenly and beguiling with his characterization  he is gentle at the same time strong, understanding but more than anything else loving. Ash is this beautiful manifestation of what real love is.\\n\\nAll the POVs were written with glowing distinction but I would like to zero in on one POV that to me is crazy monumental. I wouldnt say whos it is so as not to ruin for other readers. I loved all the POVs but this one just stood out for me. What transpired is so sensitive but its well thought out and written with so much grace and caution.\\n\\nI was certain that a mnage doesnt work. I used to think that it is make believe. Just a fantasy. But Ash, Embry and Greer proved me wrong. This triad will remain in my memory until I am grey and old. I enjoyed the kink but to me its just icing on a cake. The complexity of the characters and the multi layered plot line are its precious elements.\\n\\nThere are just two things that got me slightly restless. First, I expected more tangible and crafty damage control care of the king himself relating to the conflicts presented in American Prince. To me, the resolutions happened to be more driven by the antagonist, some outside forces and circumstances. Still, the major conflict in this third and final book is resolved because of Ashs sole decisions and actions, and I applaud the author for powerfully proving his grand purpose. Second, the concluding revelation got me happy and saying amen to the heavens, but I had that nagging feeling that its a bit off kilter to how original this series has been from the start.\\n\\nThere is no denying that Sierra Simone is an incredible story teller. I loved how she artfully fuses sexuality and spirituality with hints of symbolism at the same time making sure readers are pulled out from their comfort zones. Societal norms and beliefs embed our minds with what it thinks is right and unthinkable. But American King along with the first two books, tell us that beyond the taboo, the extremes, or the normal are hearts. We are all but humans. Whatever society has taught and is teaching us shouldnt define us. How we love should ultimately define us.\\n\\nI highly recommend The New Camelot series. If you are running for the hills because you're afraid to breach your hard limits I would understand because you will. But I promise it will be worth it. You will thank me later because this series is one class act!\"),\n",

With that out of the way, lets dig into the actual story.\\n\\nOne thing that I have always liked are the characters that Burke creates. Jo is the sister of one of the heroines from an earlier installment in the series, The Forbidden Duke. I didn't know this character well because I haven't yet read her story, but she figures prominently into the plot here. Jo comes to live with her sister after her husband dies to determine what to do with her life. While the two sisters have a very warm relationship, there is some resentment that simmers as the story progresses from their earlier days. We get to see how Noras actions that resulted in her fairytale romance have affected her sister. I honestly think this was one of the strongest relationships in this book. Typically we see the heroines of the series traipse through the pages of all the subsequent novels, and while we hear of Ivy, Lucy, and Aquilla, it is only Nora who figures prominently for the women. However the men on the other hand get their due here! Most of the Untouchables make an appearance in a hilarious scene welcoming Bran back to England. While this scene served to familiarize the reader with each of the relationships, I thought it gave WAY too much away where you really don't have to go back and read the other books because you know what happens. I think authors do themselves a disservice when they do this because instead of intriguing readers to go pick up their other books they have essentially taken that need away from them. Maybe explain a little less next time! I loved that Bran had his idiosyncrasies which made him very unique among his set, but I kept wanting to know a little bit more about what was the root of them. He is compassionate for his daughter above all else, which I have yet to read in any historical romance to date, it is usually the woman that happens to have a child from a prior relationship or out of wedlock, not the man. It is something needed in this genre for sure from time to time as it would have certainly been an issue at the time: a widowed father needs to find someone to be a mother to his children. Jo spends most of the novel wrapped up in the events of her past, both with her sister and late husband, which didn't really allow for much growth of character but I found her likable anyway.\\n\\nOne element that I picked up on early in this story is how the author explores the concept of how a bad prior relationship can taint the ability to move on and have strong positive relationship. Whether the cause is physical, sexual, or emotional those mind games can effect how you related to other people and that happens here with Jo. She struggles throughout the novel with the lasting effects of her first marriage and constantly undermines herself, until she is finally able to get out of her own way. I thought that this was very well done.\\n\\nDuring the experience of reading I thought that the plot was entertaining, but looking back on it, it was a little less exciting than other installments in this series. For the most part Jo doesnt go anywhere other than her sisters home and Brans home. It honestly felt like there were only two scenes where the plot actually moved forward  one at the very beginning and one very nearly at the end. There is a lot of exploration of character (I won't say its quite character development exactly), but nothing really happens. In The Duke of Deception the plot continually barreled forward, but it was a little lackluster here. The point of contention between the two love interests didn't lend itself to a plot with action, it was just something for the two of them to trip over and ultimately find their way into each others beds. I would have liked the plot to be bulked up more which would have added to my overall enjoyment.\\n\\nA copy of this book was received from the publicist, all opinions are my own.\"),\n",

Quinn is easy going and accepting, very positive and sweet. Gray is more reserved and suspicious, and very very protective of Quinn. Hes also very much in love with his best friend, and have never acted on his feelings.\\n\\nWhen Emery, a drifter, former circus employee and currently homeless stumbles upon their bar, his unique looks and somehow humble behavior gets Quinn curious. A little scuffle with a rude regular earns him slashed tires, and, in a roundabout way, an overnight stay with Quinn and Gray. By some miracle and a stray tree branch in a storm, Emery also gets himself a place to stay for the next couple of weeks, before he plans to move on.\\n\\nWhile Gray is slower to trust Emery, Quinn is taken with him right from the first night. The trios bond grows and strengthens and Emery basically breaks the dam between Quinn and Gray. Only hes too affected by his past and insecure by the special and years long connection between the two friends, theres a serious threat to their budding romance.\\n\\nI absolutely adored the way the three grow, assisted by the changes in the others. I loved the way the various elements of the story are layered and how beautifully each of those elements is handled by Stevens and Lee.\\n\\nLast Call is not for everyone. You need to be open minded for some threesome sexy times, you need to be accepting of the notion that each of us is free to love who and how they want. If you are, then the emotions, the challenges and the amazing storytelling is right up your alley.'),\n",

While reading this book, I was reminded why Robert Whitlow is one of my favorite authors.  This man is a gifted storyteller and he knows how to weave a story together with intrigue, mystery and characters you want to get to know better.\\n\\nThe Witnesses tells the story of two generations of the House family.  Frank is from Germany, a former Nazi and grandfather to Parker who is an attorney in a small town in North Carolina.  Both men have a unique gift that they can use for good or evil.  How will Frank reconcile his past participation in unimaginable horrors?  Will he ever find rest and peace for his soul?  Parkers career is just beginning, hes the new man on the totem and working long hours.  How long will he have to wait to sink his teeth into some weighty cases and prove himself as an attorney?\\n\\nAs the storyline develops, Robert slowly unveils the characters, layer by layer.  He has keen, thought provoking and honest insights into people and their circumstances.  His characters are very relatable.  I especially liked the relationships: between Frank and Parker and their love and respect for one another, the friendship between Frank and his longtime friend Lenny and the instantaneous bond between Layla and Frank.  As a Christian, I appreciate how Robert weaves the Christian faith into his characters lives.  He did a great job in presenting the Gospel message and showing the Christian faith lived out in everyday life.  I would never have guessed that I would like a story that involves a former Nazi, much less like the character; but I did.\\n\\nThis book is well written, with interesting characters that will draw you in.  I found myself thinking about the characters when I wasn't reading, they kind of come alive.  One thing I love about a book is when a character perfectly expresses what youve been feeling, but didn't quite know how to put into words.\\n\\nI highly recommend The Witnesses by Robert Whitlow, a tale of two men who have a unique gift of seeing what will happen in the future.  One man is looking back on a life with some very ugly sins he cant seem to get away from and the other just starting his career.  Will he put his career over and above love?  To find out what happens in the lives of these men you will want to read The Witnesses by Robert Whitlow.\\n\\nI would like to thank BookLook and Thomas Nelson Publishers for providing me a free copy The Witnesses by Robert Whitlow.

Author McCall Smith has teased out the painful lives of Bertie and his father Stuart at the hands of the loathsome mother/wife Irene for many a volume.  \"A Time of Love...\" finally moves toward some resolution of the situation, while basting the story with anticipation that efforts to find gender balance in society will inevitably go to extreme before finding equilibrium.  Irene, already established as a thoroughly unlikeable character by almost every man, woman and dog in Scotland, becomes completely incorrigible here, as a convenience to the story line.

I'm so thrilled to say that I loved this book beyond words. Was everything I wanted this to be and more. Okay, fine, the romance I wanted wasn't included, but everything else was.\\n\\nThe writing is gorgeous in this book too, and I loved that a whole bunch. Once I started reading this one, I couldn't stop until I had finished it. While there were a few things that bothered me a lot, I loved this book so much. I'm giving it five stars. Because it was all kinds of interesting and exciting and I just loved it all so much.\\n\\nI just so wish that this one had been even longer. Because that ending just about killed me. So rude. Yet so perfect and not a bad cliffhanger. I'm just not sure I can survive the wait for book three, haha. I know that one will be amazing. And hoping it will have what was missing from this one. Oh, how I hope so. Will be crossing all my fingers. But anyway. Spectacle was an incredible book. I loved everything about it, except for one small part. But the rest was amazing. Sigh. And horrible, of course, like Menagerie was. But so perfect. I loved it all. I loved that this book is also mostly from the point of view of Delilah, and sometimes a few other amazing characters. It was just the best. I loved getting to read a bit from some of my favorite characters too. Yay.\\n\\nThere is also sort of a recap in the early pages of just about everything that happened in book one, which will be good for those who did not re-read, but considering I did re-read book one first, I found this to be highly annoying. Ack. Yet it didn't last long, and I did love reading about it all again. Just didn't need it. But besides that, the writing was stunning. And I'm so happy about that. This book takes place three months after the end of book one. And I loved that too; but I did also want to read about those missing months.\\n\\nSo much is happening in this amazing sequel. I don't know how to talk about it all. I shall try to mention some of it. There are new characters, though we don't get to know them that well. I did like reading about them all, however. One of them ended up dead, which made me a tiny bit sad, lol. But still, didn't feel too badly about it even so. This one also takes place in a whole new place, which was pretty terrifying. Yet I adored it lots at the same time. It was interesting to get to know this horrible place and all the people too.\\n\\nThe plot in this book is about the menagerie with Delilah running it being captured. And they are all taken. The new place they end up in is all kinds of different from the menagerie. It's way worse in most ways. And better in other ways. But either way, they are all captives again, after having just taken their freedom back. Aw. It was simply all kinds of heartbreaking to read about. I adored all of these characters so much. And reading about them hurting and being hurt was the worst thing. It hurt so badly. Yet written so good.\\n\\nI'm not going to say much about the plot. Just they Delilah and everyone else is spending most of this one just trying to survive in this new place. Trying to survive he horrible owner, whom is renting out the creatures. And it is so brutal and awful to read about. Yet so interesting too, and I couldn't help but love it all. I adored reading more about Gallagher too. He is my favorite character. I loved how protective he is of Delilah, how he would do anything for her. Still no romance, but I still feel it between them, growing, lol.\\n\\nI must mention something. Because it's bothering me a little bit. Okay, it's bothering me like crazy, and I don't think I will forget about it for quite some time. This will be a bit spoilery. In the middle of the book, Delilah wakes up, having just forgotten eight weeks of time. And this ruined my heart. Because she had forgotten this huge moment, and I needed to read about it, and now I won't, and I just. I hope it will be mentioned in book three. Because I need these missing memories more than I can say. All the sobs.\\n\\nBut yeah, it was an amazing plot twist, for sure. But I also wish it hadn't happened. Because we missed so much and that bothers me a lot. The memory loss didn't have to be included, I don't feel like, because I didn't think the reason for why it happened was good enough. Aw. Hoping it will be a big deal in book three. Fingers crossed. But anyway. I loved this book so, so much. Despite all of this. I just adored Delilah the very most. She's still so strong and kind and I just love her to pieces. And all her powers too. Eee.\\n\\nHuge thank you to the publisher for accepting my request to read this book early via Netgalley. Means the most to me. So glad I didn't have to wait longer to read it. And so glad that I read it just now. Because this book was all kinds of amazing. If you still haven't read book one, Menagerie, then get moving. Because it's amazing. I simply loved Spectacle beyond words. It's an incredible sequel filled with excitement and mysteries and horrible people. There was so much to love about it. And I loved it all. You must read this.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis review was first posted on my blog, Carina's Books. Read it in February.\"),\n",

       "   \"I really do want to like this story; for the most part it is very well written and psychologically deep. I rather enjoy angst and there is plenty of that to go around as one might expect given the book summary. However I find the sexual allusions and thoughts of sexual frustration of both characters--something that seems to come up almost every couple of pages to an unrealistic degree--to be incredibly distracting. The husband especially is a complete horn ball and it makes him seem incredibly shallow and creepy; it's making it hard for me to want to continue on reading. Be forewarned that there is a LOT of England/London based slang which--while not a bad thing--might take a little getting used to.\"),\n",

       "   \"Loved it! A no-nonsense police procedural set in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Dark River Rising really puts you in that place. I've been to New Orleans many times but have never ventured north. Now I would like to, just to see where this all took place.\\n\\nAs an attorney with experience in both law enforcement and prosecution, not a lick of what takes place in this novel seemed out of place or over the top. The interplay of federal, state and local law enforcement was particularly on point, it seemed to me.\\n\\nWhile the procedural aspect is a strong suit for Dark River Rising, it's not its strongest suit. It's characters, after all, that people want to read about. Detective Wallace Hartman of the Baton Rouge PD is a strong female lead, not overdrawn so as to prove the (male) author's deep knowledge of women, but plenty to carry the novel. Her federal partner for the case, DEA Special Agent Mason Cunningham, is a desk jockey number-cruncher who ventures into the field to try to prove his theory about the cocaine trade in Louisiana. Hartman's field experience versus Mason's federal depth of resources (along with his firm grasp of those resources) establishes a working balance between the two that leads to mutual respect and maybe, just maybe something more between them.\\n\\nDark River Rising reads like a movie, so much so that as I was reading this morning I didn't want to step away to eat breakfast, afraid I would miss something. Just briefly, I forgot I could put it down and start again where I had stopped. Now that's a novel that's doing it's job!\\n\\nHighly recommended!\"),\n",

There is emphasis on requiring compatibility with Lorentz invariance without negating an aether entirely. The book begins with conversations between a professor and interested students, where connection between rest energy and speed of light emphasizes that matter is made up of light. Then in analogy to sound, we see that an airplane can carry air (aether) past the speed of sound, but an object which in a way is made up of sound waves cannot do so. This deduction is critical to understanding relativistic velocity addition. Starting from this historical motivation, the book leads with progressively more advanced calculation to the aether in modern context: critical field strengths in the quantum vacuum and the unresolved issues of acceleration.\"),\n",

       "   'This is another book that I have mixed feelings on though I\\'d rate it as a good read.\\n\\nThe chemistry between the two leads is fantastic, the dialogue and internal thoughts are witty, fun, and natural, the storyline is solid, the Hollywood industry was captured well, and it had the best, most accurate use of Twitter (and modern social media) I\\'ve read to date. The supporting characters are incorporated nicely and we get a good feel for the leads despite not getting much of their backstory. The quality of the book is high and I found Jennifer to be the overall appeal of the story. There\\'s a lot of good here.\\n\\nWhat is somewhat halting, though, is that it\\'s a story that focuses on going after personal goals, sacrificing relationships and to some extent one-self in the pursuit. Because of this, we get a mix of Jennifer and Suzanne in present day and flashbacks where we KNOW things go badly so, while we\\'re to enjoy the leads coming together, we also know they\\'re doomed. Jennifer\\'s character also becomes less likable with time and, though that\\'s intentional by the writer, it made me as the reader not like her too much as the book went on. These elements cast a shadow on the enjoyment.\\n\\nWe do get a happy, satisfying resolution and Jennifer\\'s character is redeemed by the end. I came away from the book with a description of \"Cute\"...this was a cute story which is a word I don\\'t use often for a book review. lol. There\\'s some touching depth, as well, so it\\'s not all fluff but the fairy-tale aspect and the separation of the leads keeps the story on more of a high-level entertaining type read.'),\n",

What was more interesting to me was the attitudes towards women and what happened when a woman colored outside the lines in these days just after the Civil War in Middle America. Gamber uses newspaper accounts (not entirely reliable then, as now, I suppose), and court documents and transcripts. It's a very detailed story of a double murder and the investigation followed by five court trials. You leave the book feeling like you are well familiar with the place of women in the time.\"),\n",

So many times I would juice when I wasn't feeling quite well or when I was working too many hours and needed the energy to keep going to finish projects by a strict deadline. And, then there were juicing times when I was determined I would juice every day for my health.  But, too many times there were mornings when grabbing a cup of coffee was easier and quicker than juicing.\\n\\nI knew juicing was a wonderful way to insure I was feeling good and had good steady energy throughout the day.  I always felt better drinking fresh juice filled with live enzymes, but somehow I would drift away from juicing and reach for coffee and a sugar filled pastry or, on a good day, a granola bar.  Also, I knew the coffee and pastry could not replace the wonderful nutrition filled fresh juice.\\n\\nSo, the cycle continued until Steve & Julie Prussack brought the JUICE GURU to the world.  To date, I have juiced every day and sometimes twice a day.  My juicer remains on the counter, the refrigerator has beautiful fresh fruit and vegetables cleaned and ready to make juice.\\n\\nThe best part is I just don't want sugary treats and rarely want coffee.  I don't deny myself either if I want them, but I seldom do.  I have dropped a few pounds without trying and I truly feel better.  I am grateful to be making daily juicing a habit and very grateful to find it has been easy to do.\\n\\nMy thanks to Steve & Julie Prussack for this book and the wisdom it contains!\"),\n",

I have read Two Heart's Christmas Wish in the Mistletoe Kisses an Christmas Wishes anthology and I fell in love with the Wounded Warrior books.  There is also another of the Wounded Warrior books in the In Times of Love and War Anthology.  They can be stand alone books but they are also spin offs of each other.\\nIn Two Heart's Surrendered, Tamara Ferguson introduces us to Luke Bryant and Kelly Callahan when they were really young.  Kelly was six years old and Luke was 13.  Kelly was about to drown when Luke ran to save her.  Dan, Kelly's older brother, was extremely grateful that Luke saved his sister and befriended Luke.\\nOnce he was old enough Luke enlisted in the Air Force to become a pilot.  When Kelly was 18 she declared her love to Luke when he was home for leave.  He convinced her that it wasn't mutual and that she needed to move on.  When Kelly was 20 she was in her sister's wedding and to her shock and suprise Luke was there.  He looked so good in his uniform.  She still fought her feelings for him.  But when they were walking and talking Luke confessed the he did love her.  That he was wrong before for telling her to move on and forget him.  That even though he had told her that, he was unable to do the same.\\nTwo short days later, Luke was sent back to Iraq, Kelly and Luke wrote back and forth as much as possible.  Luke called to let her know he wouldn't be able to come home for his leave because he was going to be involved in a secret mission and she may not hear from him for a while.  Nervous and heart broken, Kelly graduated college with honors, moved back home, and as the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months, she got a call from her brother.  He had found Luke and Luke had been severly injured.  Kelly wanted to go to him but the problem was Luke didn't want her to see him.\\nKelly did everything she could to see to Lukes needs without him knowing. Can she get him to want to see her again?  Can she make him see that no matter what happened to him it will not in anyway affect how she feels about him?  The way Kelly and her family have rallied together to help Luke is astounding.\\nThis book touches all the feelings.  Tears, laughter, heartache, lonliness, and LOVE.\\nWONDERFUL read and I hope Tamara Ferguson keeps introducing us to many more wounded warriors.  This is a subject near and dear to my heart.\\nKelli Harper\"),\n",

She has shown it countless times while on her horse to him, he just has to let her do it outside the barn, especially when a relationship is involved.  Cam has known Lilly for years and has always thought of her as a little sister.  That is until one night when he takes her on the dance floor and he realizes how special she is, showing him she is the one.\\n\\nTime and time again Jami Davenport has proven she is a skilled author and I must say in all honesty this is one of the best ones of hers I have read. You hear it from 4 different angels which is very different but yet it isnt. It touches the heart in so many ways and there are times when you can actually picture what is happening in your mind.  This book is a Super Bowl Champion!!\"),\n",

The next scene is months later when Sarah is moving in to a little town called redemption. Here she moves into the house neighboring a woman in her 60s named Cilla. Cilla has her own demons with an abusive husband who took his life, Cilla feels the guilt of that every day and has cocooned herself in her house. Her nephew Jake and her great nephew Olly, are both lost souls as well. Jake has a huge tragedy he's trying to get over and Olly's mother has just entered rehab, therefore, he is dealing with abandonment issues. Setting the plot with all this baggage and damaged lives it is interesting how the author creates a journey of hope and renewal for each of these characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a lighthearted greed and enjoys characters finding happiness in what seems like a never ending tragedy. I especially enjoyed the foreshadowing the name of the town brings and how redemption is truly centralize part of the story.\\nI would like to thank the publisher and net galley for offering me a free copy in order for me to write an honest review.\"),\n",

       "   \"I loved this book! Possibly because I went to high school in the 60s, and this story is set at a high school in 1960? Nah -- there the similarity ends! This story revolves around two 16 year olds at a private boarding school in the east, both of them  new to the school. Susannah, the new girl, gets taken into the cool girls clique right away, even though she is a sophomore and the cool girls are juniors and seniors. The other new girl is Moll, also a sophomore. So why did I relate to this so much? I went to a small public high school in a beach town in Southern California, and was definitely not part of the cool girls clique! But part of the reason so much of this story resonated with me was the shame and anxiety that Moll felt as she tried to fit in or at least find her place in the weird world of high school. I'm fairly sure most high school girls have felt similar feelings.\\n\\nIn The Other New Girl, Moll, a brilliant but nerdy social outcast, is encouraged by her only friend Susannah to overcome her fears enough to get her courage up to the point where she can attend a school dance. She works hard on looking right, trying SO hard to fit in, and finally overcomes her anxiety and fear enough to get herself there. But then (in what I thought might become a Carrie moment), she experiences bullying that is so hurtful to her that she decides to take extreme action as she desperately wants to find out who she wants to be. As her actions and disappearance reverberate throughout the school (especially for Susannah), the book explores themes of loyalty, obedience to authority, friendship, and betrayal.\\n\\nNot exactly a mystery or a thriller or a coming of age story, it is all three! It is a very compelling read that is extremely well done, with realistic characters, dialogue, and situations (even for those of us who haven't been to a private boarding school in the East). With thanks to NetGalley and She Writes Press, this one gets five starsand I look forward to reading more of Ms. Gschwandtners work.\"),\n",

       "   'Grace and her family have just moved to a new town after her Baptist preacher mother has a spiritual experience and their small Kentucky town decides she is far too progressive for their community. Grace is shunned and the family basically flees for more open-minded pastures. Erin is a beautiful girl who loves science and Star Trek: The Next Generation. She also has Asperger\\'s and a secret. Rosina is a lesbian struggling to be herself within the confines of her conservative Mexican family. She dreams only of playing music and escaping her town, instead of taking care of her gaggle of cousins and working in her uncle\\'s restaurant. Grace soon learns that the former occupant of her new house was Lucy Moynihan, who accused some popular boys of rape. Lucy wasn\\'t believed, had a breakdown, and left town. While she\\'s never been one to stand up for anything before, this angers Grace in a way she cannot fully describe. Erin and Rosina empathize with Lucy\\'s situation, too. So the three find themselves an unlikely trio, and they do something even more unlikely: they form a secret group, made up entirely of girls, to protest the horrible culture at their school--a culture that condones things like rape and mistreatment of women. The group quickly takes off and the three girls realize that the group--and this cause--is far bigger than themselves.\\n\\nThis is an incredibly timely, wonderfully descriptive, and well-written novel that encapsulates the struggle felt by teenagers and young women in dealing with sexual assault, rape, and violence against women. There\\'s a definite trigger for sexual assault/rape, so do avoid this novel if that is an issue for you. This book can certainly be painful to read, but it\\'s an amazing read and incredibly powerful, as well.\\n\\nThe theme of boys and men getting away with horrible things in their towns seems so popular of late in books I\\'ve been reading. That could mean that The Nowhere Girls is repetitive, but it\\'s not at all. It\\'s a wonderful additional to this topic, which is a discouraging one and quite representative of how things are in our current society.\\n\\nFor me, the strength of this novel came with its characters and its brutal honesty. I really loved the three main characters, especially Erin, and just felt for all three girls. This is the first book I\\'ve read by Amy Reed (but won\\'t be the last), and I was so impressed by her writing. The girls pop off the pages. The novel is written from the perspective of Grace, Erin, and Rosina, as well as Lucy and \"Us\"--a section that depicts the state of things from various high school females. Reed gives us a fairly diverse cast, including Rosina, whose family are Mexican immigrants; a character with autism in Erin; and several LGBTQIA characters. And, of course, it\\'s wonderful to have so many female perspectives represented. We also get a few glimpses of some of the boys via excerpts from a despicable blog, which is quite effective in its own right.\\n\\nAs I said, so much of the strength of this book comes from its honesty. It doesn\\'t shy away from the fact that the female teens are dealing with some very harsh realities in relation to sex, and it makes it clear how much they truly have to deal with. There are some extremely powerful moments in this novel (there\\'s a chapter that occurs with some of the girls in a model home, and it\\'s just wow. Amazing). It lays so much bare about what high school girls truly must go through. I found the brutal and realistic look at women and sex refreshing--albeit terrifying and heartbreaking. Rape, sexual assault, the power of sex, the way these women use sex to relate to each other and to boys--it\\'s all there, and the result is heartbreaking, sad, powerful, and yes, sometimes hopeful.\\n\\nA few times, I wasn\\'t sure if I always believed how the authority figures dealt with the girls and their group, but, truly, it\\'s probably a realistic portrayal of small town America. The ending was also a little neat, but still worked in the context of this novel. I kept thinking how much I\\'d like my daughters to read this book when they\\'re older, because there is so much here: so many talking points and truths and so many wonderful and strong women among all the sadness.\\n\\nIn the end, this was a slow-moving book at times, but it was so well-written and a very powerful read. The characters are so strong, and you truly become part of their world as you read. I feel as if this is a must-read for female teens, and it\\'s just so timely now in our culture, where the news brings more sexual assault talk each evening. There is something about this book that will leave you with hope, despite the horrors, and that\\'s so important right now. Definitely a worthwhile read.\\n\\nI received a copy of this novel from the publisher and Edelweiss (thank you!) in return for an unbiased review.'),\n",

Even with her miraculous lottery win, Kit has no interest breaking out of her comfort zone and living up to her actual potential.\\n\\nBen Tucker and his partner see Kits potential and want, more than anything to get Kit out of her current job, town, and life.  Shes an incredibly intelligent and talented scientist who refuses to leave her university job.  Though Kit finds the job satisfying, it doesnt truly challenge her or push her scientific limits.  In fact, Kit is the only one who cant, or refuses to see how stagnant her job and life has become.  When Ben Tucker walks into her lab and pitches her a totally new job, in a new state, with state of the art everything, he expects her to jump at the opportunity.  What he gets is a resounding NO!\\n\\nThe minute Ben Tucker leaves Kits presence he not only knows he screwed up horribly and he must see her again.  Kit is Ben and his partners way out of a job they have both worked very hard to get out of, but that inexplicably isn't the reason he wants to see her again.  Behind the glasses, shy demeanor, and adamant refusal of his spectacular job offer, Ben sees a beautiful woman with a world of potential he wants to know absolutely everything about.\\n\\nGetting to know Kit isn't the easiest thing in the world and Bens in with her happens quite by accident.  With part of her lottery winnings, Kit bought a ramshackle home that needs a ton of repairs.  As fate would have it, Bens father owns an architectural salvage yard that has so much of what Kit wants for her home.  As the days and weeks go by, Kit and Ben become so much a part of each others lives which forces each to confront some hard truths.  Ben must admit to himself and his partner his true involvement with Kit and how he no longer cares if she takes the job, and Kit must confront the fact that she is indeed in something of a rut and she doesnt find a way to deal with her issues, she won't ever be able to find true happiness.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line: While there were parts of this book I liked, I found the read as a whole to be somewhat flat.  Kit is so much of an introvert as to be a nearly non-existent character, and thats a special kind of talent when you're the lead female in a story.  Ben is somewhat more extroverted and interesting, but only just.  In truth, the most significant character in this book is Bens dad, who is loud and funny and really makes his presence felt.  I genuinely liked the plot of this book but feel it would have been much better served by stronger, more forceful characters.  Because of the plot and the plot alone, I stuck with this book to the bitter end but cant honestly say Ill be sticking around for the coming books in the series.\"),\n",

       "   'Youd think after five books, the Extinction Cycle might start to get a bit stale. Somehow, though, Nicholas Sansbury Smith has managed to keep this series rocking and rolling, presenting a cross-genre affair that continues to impress and excite.\\n\\nIve really appreciated the way Smith continues to up the ante, transforming the Variant threat into a global crises that only grows more and more complicated. The elements involved in crafting an Extinction book work wonderfully well, and Smith ties up action, science, horror, and military thriller into a tight, impossible to put down read. Even after five books, Im still on the edge of my seat.\\n\\nHere, Team Ghost, led as always by Reed Beckham, are making their last-ditch push toward ending the threat of the monstrous Variants, whose offspring have evolved some particularly nasty new elements that allow Smith to craft several wonderfully gruesome scenes. Packed with a ton of action and a lot of heart, were taken across multiple front lines on land and at sea as Team Ghost contends with monsters and monstrous humans. The fighting is intense and masterfully crafted (a staple of this series), right on up through an excellent climax that blends the suspense and action of Aliens and Die Hard (or maybe Under Siege is a better example), with a lot of heart-string tugging and plenty more oh sh moments.\\n\\nFor all intents and purposes, this is supposedly the last book in the series, although theres plenty of wiggle room left for another book if the author so chooses. And if it is, in fact, the last book, rest assured that Smith is not resting on his laurels here.\\n\\nIve been a big fan of this series, and this might be the best entry of the lot. Smith gets full-on cinematic in his epicness here. As far as Im concerned, this is a fitting conclusion for Sgt. Reed Beckham, Dr. Kate Lovato, and the other members of Team Ghost. If we do get a sixth book down the line, Ill definitely be reading it (especially if Smith presents some of the catastrophe and struggle in Europe or Asia. This series has been focused on the US front-lines of the war, but Im itching to see a more global examination of the story.).

These Main Characters are Awesome and you are rooting for them to get together sooner rather than later from the first.

This couple grows from Noah being a mischievous scamp to being a protective Man for his Woman and Olivia moves from being icy and stoic with a wall around her heart to a woman willing to melt for this man.

       "   'This may be one of those books that you\\'ll either hate or love.  Looking at the reviews there are very very few 3 stars, but lots of 5s, 2s, & 1s.\\nBased on the cover, Wolf is a new author and as such is definitely to be complimented. But there are some rough edges. The Cons: First and most problematic: the story doesn\\'t GO anywhere. Its main function seems to be setting up the world and (some of) the characters for the two future books. I took one star away because as it is, this book left me hanging. Second, while I might be forgetting some, there are (at least) 8 narratives threading through the book (but at least each thread is in a separate chapter). 8! Pretty ambitious if the intent was to craft eight 5 star story-lines. I guess it\\'s like a smorgasbord, something there for everyone. One of the threads has virtually nothing to do with the rest and it was, I believe, an mistake to include it. I\\'d have much rather the characters DO something. Third, in some ways this reminds me of the \"Girls Gone Wild\" videos. Wolf seems to be preoccupied with breasts, which is a bit strange for something that\\'s more chick-lit than not. The women are the warriors in the \\'main\\' culture and have matching aggressive libidos. (Yet the warriors mostly reach adulthood (17) with their virginity intact (or so the narrative says). It makes no sense. Rigid roles, randy (adult) women, but \\'pure\\' teens? What?). Well, at least there\\'s equal objectification of the sexes. Fourth, there\\'s some gaping plot holes, and just as bad there\\'s some story-line jumps that make no sense (and aren\\'t explained). A poisoned wound- unexplained. A conspiracy - unexplained (and much much worse, not even investigated after it\\'s uncovered). A main character without his body guards. Not once, but twice! (said character is supposedly surrounded by bodyguards, except when he\\'s not. What?!) A unlikely meeting at an Inn. A completely confusing (and dream-like; at least I sure don\\'t understand it) attack on two leaders of the Kingdom (bodyguards? honor guard? we don\\'t need no stinkin\\' security!) It left me scratching my head. Fifth, count how many times warriors \"trained from birth\", don\\'t \"bother\" to bring their weapons with them, how often they hesitate, and how awfully disciplined they are. It should be embarrassing. (I wonder if both this and the lack of security indicate Wolf never was exposed to disciplined training? To be clear, teens can be both forgetful and undisciplined, but I\\'d expect in a society which honors warriors and is surrounded by many enemies, that those flaws would be extinguished before adulthood (17). Sixth: Too many \"that\\'s just an old fairy tale\" creatures and people suddenly pop-up. Gimme a break. Seventh, and lastly: too many \"words\" are introduced without explanation. This is probably mostly me, at my advanced age, my retention isn\\'t as good as it once was, but Wolf clearly is on the far side of the line between \"foreign flavor\" and \"confusing (and off-putting) gobble-gobble\". The Pros: Wolfs narration is quite good. The characters and the world is well fleshed out. While sometimes it seems as if the characters have been inserted in a context like dolls and accessories in a doll house, once they\\'re in the situation, they behave (exceptions noted) believably. Many of the chapters are quite enjoyable. Which leads me to the title of this review, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. If the amount of enthusiasm I had at the end of many of the chapters equated to the enthusiasm at the end of the book, this would have been a 5 star review. Right now, it\\'s averaging 3.7 stars, and that\\'s pretty close to where I\\'d put it.'),\n",

It\\'s not particularly thick at 180 pages, but it is packed with economic and political facts and observations about where we\\'ve come from and where we go from here.

Instead, it documents history and observes the challenges ahead.\\n\\nTimes are changing fast. Politically, in the US and elsewhere, we\\'ve seen the pendulum swing back from the rush towards \"inevitable hyper-globalization,\" to economic nationalism.

Dr. Bridens attitude towards food was so refreshing and reassuring to me after years of swinging miserably between deprivation and binging. Youre allowed to feel satisfied with your food, and its possible to feel satisfied without sugar, dairy, wheat, or whatever your body is sensitive to.

       "   'I bought this book to read to my children during the month of May, to help prepare them for consecrating themselves to the Blessed Virgin Mary. It\\'s divided into 33 short \"conferences\", one to be read each day of the month, ending with the Consecration on Day 34. While some of the conferences are probably very beautiful and inspiring, my kids will never know -- unless they first chug through 18 children\\'s classics as a prerequisite to consecrating themselves to Our Blessed Mother! Sound weird? Yeah, to me too.\\n\\nWhen I purchased this book, I\\'d read in the blurb that the author uses a few children\\'s stories to make some of her points. But I was totally unprepared for and very dismayed by the many, many references to fiction books sprinkled throughout. When I picked it up and started reading aloud Day One to my sons, I stopped short at the second paragraph. The entire rest of the conference talked about nothing but the lion character, Aslan, in the Chronicles of Narnia, comparing him to Christ. My boys aren\\'t into fantasy and have never read the Chronicles of Narnia. A little upset, I flipped to Day Two. The story of Aslan continued. Okay, so jump to Day Three. By this time, I was really hoping the author would start talking about Our Lord or Our Lady. Nope. All of a sudden we have a new character, Digory, from the book \"The Magician\\'s Nephew.\" To say I was getting frustrated is an understatement. The spell of reading to my sons had been broken, and I was starting to wonder what kind of book I\\'d spent my money on. I sent them off to play while I rifled through the next few conferences. FINALLY one was about Our Lady and the Annunciation, which came at Day Four. Immediately following, on Day Five, was a long reference to the characters in the novel, Little Lord Fauntleroy, comparing Cedric\\'s love of his mom to Christ\\'s love for His Mother. My sons had not read that book either. Great.\\n\\nBy this time I was pretty dismayed. I looked in the index and discovered that the author compares Our Lady\\'s life and devotion to Her to no less than EIGHTEEN children\\'s books, everything from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (I jest not) to Green Eggs and Ham and Winnie-the-Pooh. Out of the eighteen books referenced, my sons were only familiar with four of them. Even of those four, I couldn\\'t figure out what on earth they had to do with loving the Blessed Virgin at all. My heart sank as I realized I would be skipping many of the conferences in this book, unless I waited a year and read all those novels to my children first.\\n\\nI put the book on the shelf and haven\\'t picked it up since. I somehow doubt I ever will. It could have been such a beautiful treasure, but instead it was extremely disappointing.'),\n",

Quite unexpectedly, she receives a desperate request from her estranged mother, sending her from New York to Florida, where she \"meets\" an antique desk . . . . . . and a fascinating man. Struggling to overcome writer\\'s block, she makes a decision that will fortunately or unfortunately change the course of her career, and perhaps even her family history.\\n\\nBirdie Shehorn is one of many sought-after heiresses during the Gilded Age; beautiful, rich, and headed for an arranged marriage, unless she can assert her independence over an overbearing mother. Longing to use her education wisely, Birdie secretly pursues a writing career, writing furiously on a beautiful desk tucked deep inside her third floor attic. When presented with a rare opportunity to marry for love, it appears that all will be lost in expectations, unless truth can forge a way.\\n\\nThis lovely dual timeline traces the lives of two very different women, with remarkably similar struggles, and hearts that long for a forever love. Rachel Hauck has certainly penned a satisfying blend of winsome wit and classic romance!\\n\\nI received a copy of this book from the author. The opinions stated are entirely my own.'),\n",

Years later Rhett is a big Hollywood talk-show host and Summer is bringing her 14 year old son to Moonlight to spend time with his father, Hunter McCroy.\\n\\nSummer, Hunter, and Rhett have tangled pasts that come unraveled when they meet again in their hometown. Summer can't let go of the anger caused by Hunter and his parents' mistreatment of her when she discovered she was pregnant. Her whole life course changed after one night and left her a single mom with a struggling music career in Nashville. Hunter almost made it to the big leagues, but an injury and downward spiral into addiction landed him back home and learning how to be a father after years of not acknowledging his son. Then, there's the golden boy Rhett. His charm and determination took him to the height of success in Hollywood, but a tragic accident sends him running to Moonlight to remember who he is.\\n\\nLiz Talley takes three complex characters and seamlessly weaves their paths together. I wasn't sure what kind of story I was getting into when I read the blurb, but when I finished I knew for sure that Come Home to Me veers into new territory for me.

The characters are beautifully flawed, and when they're honest with themselves they learn to be better people for themselves and as an example for others.

He is a artist that would go in the rides before the park opens and do touch up paint and such where as needed. That in itself is a dream come true for a LOT of Disney fans.

Early in the book, Janet describes several key events in her life including growing up in rural Mississippi in the midst of racial turmoil and desegregation, losing her first child, and pivoting her career path to follow her passion.  This helps sets the stage to make the book more like an authentic conversation with the author, instead of a how to  manual.  Throughout the book, there is a common theme that great leadership is possible, but it takes practice and patience (as well as the right ingredients).  Janet even weaves this theme into making a cake in Chapter 10 -  Caramel Cake and Culture.  There is even a recipe for the cake!  While there are no short cuts to great leadership, the ingredients are well defined and proven, giving the reader both inspiration as well as practical tips to put gracious leadership in action..'),\n",

He was working for the CIA and somehow had infiltrated a field unit of the terror group Al Quada remaining with them for three years.  He learned their language, learned their methods, and thought highly enough of their religion to become a convert. His return to the CIA was forced by having to openly turn on the group he was with in order to forestall an attack on the west.\\n\\n  In the book \"the Deceivers\", Vinnie Duto, former head of the CIA  is now the president of the United States.  He calls John into his office after an attack by terrorists occurs in Dallas, Texas.  It is the most horrific attack ever and John is positive that he would be assigned to go after the perpetrators.  Somewhat to his surprise the president does not want him to investigate Dallas but to travel to\\n\\nColumbia to pick up information from an old asset living there and deliver it to headquarters.\\n\\n  However, the trip turns out to be one of the deadliest assignments John has been assigned to.  It brings him into a world of sleeper cells, sniper teams and double agents high up in the United States government.  The information obtained also seems to point out a plot by the Russian government to initiate a coup to take over the American government. And the attack on Dallas is found to be related to the scheme.\\n\\n  Mr Berenson\\'s John Wells novels are all punctuated by constant action and the \"Deceivers\" is no exception.  A turn in the enemy Wells faces seems to be broadcast by the possibility of the Russian government being involved in planning a coup.  The author slightly plays down the possibility of radical Islamists being the cause of world wide terrorism by introducing several Muslims who are against these actions.  But whoever the real enemy is John Wells being a part of US anti terrorism activities will remain in the fight supplying the reader with one engrossing book after another.'),\n",

As the title says, it is a guide for those who want to make a pilgrimage through the missions that Junipero Serra founded along the California coast in the late 1700s. The book covers all the bases. It has a historical review of Serra's life and the founding of the missions. It looks at the spirituality of Serra and Saint Francis, since Serra was a Franciscan who took to heart Francis's simplicity of life and importance of evangelism. It also looks at the spirituality of the natives and how they were treated by the missionaries and by the Spanish and later Mexican governments. Binz is refreshingly honest about the mistreatment of the native Californians and the both good and bad impacts of European life. The last two thirds of the book describes the missions in turn.\\n\\nEach description covers the history of the mission including its current condition (some were better preserved than others). Binz also provides an overview of the saint to whom the mission is dedicated (e.g. San Juan Capistrano is named after Saint John of Capistrano, a fourteenth century Franciscan who preached and taught in Europe). He describes the mission bells and the current church in detail. He's also composed some prayers for pilgrims to say at the churches. Finally, he describes any museum and grounds around the church, along with nearby points of interest.\\n\\nThe book makes for a fascinating arm-chair pilgrimage. I am very interested in taking my family to travel from mission to mission as a pilgrimage/vacation. This book will be very handy companion on that trip. It is thorough and compact.\\n\\nHighly recommended, even if you don't plan to visit the missions in California.\"),\n",

The atmosphere was rather depressing with dead bodies along the road and often witnessing animal cruelty and neglect.\\n\\nMrs. Dobbe found very few positive things about her job at the international school.

       "   'First, I would like to extend a heartfelt Thank you to Debra Clopton and her publisher for sending me a copy of \"Kissed By A Cowboy\" to review for them. I am truly grateful for this generosity. I really appreciate the time, effort and expense it takes to make a reviewer copy available to me.\\n\\nKissed By A Cowboy by Debra Clopton is the amazing third offering in her Four of Hearts Ranch series.  Opening the cover of this engaging page-turner is like visiting old friends for those who have read the first two books in the series.  But this novel also reads well on its own, so I recommend it even if you haven\\'t experienced the previous stories.\\n\\nJarrod Monahan took it hard when he discovered his fathers betrayal of his family.  He and his brothers worked very hard to rescue the Four of Hearts Ranch.  Now that the ranch is finally about to become profitable, cattle rustlers put them in jeopardy again.  So when he sees some activity at his abandoned neighbors property, he is surprised to see the girl he kissed then ran away from so many years ago.\\n\\nCassidy Starr has returned to Wishing Springs, Texas and the property her Aunt Roxie left her now that shes come to her senses, filed for divorce and sworn off romance for good.  With plans to make a life for herself by running her property as a bed and breakfast and a strawberry farm, she finds herself fighting those old feelings when she sees Jarrod and he continues to offer to help her.\\n\\nDebra Clopton has written another beautiful story in a series that Ive got on my keeper shelf.  These books will bring giggles and tears and a sigh or two and are easily enjoyed over and over again.'),\n",

I can just picture walking down the streets wandering through the shops of Honey Springs.\\n\\nI was glad to see  that Patrick is startng to open up more to Roxie and actually helps her solve the murder of Fred Hill.

       "   \"I read the first Pendergast book Relic a couple of years ago and since then I have this been a favorite series of mine. It has been an interesting journey where I have learned more about Aloysius Pendergast and his family as the books progress and now here we are at book 16.\\n\\nPendergast is missing after the harrowing ending in the last book, and no one knows if he is alive or dead. For Constance, his ward is this a traumatizing experience and she has decided to retreat to the world she is so familiar with, the chambers below the Pendergast mansion. However, and an old enemy has returned, someone that she knows very well. But, Constance will soon learn that not everything is as it seems.\\n\\nAs with most books in this series was The Obsidian Chamber a pure joy to read. I miss the time when I had several Pendergast books to read, but in a way is it also nice to get a new one every year. This book felt more like a Constance book than an Aloysius Pendergast book. Of course, he is not totally missing from the book, but much of the story is about Constance. It's actually a bit tricky to write this review without spoiling too much of the story, like for instance who is back. So, I will just write some general thoughts about the book.\\n\\nConstance is an intersecting character, not my personal favorite, but her backstory is truly intriguing and her first introduction to the series was spectacular. I do find myself not overfond with her growing attraction to Aloysius. I just can't seem to enjoy that idea. I must prefer her just being his ward. She has a central role in this book, and I did enjoy her part in this book. I was a bit surprised by her action in this book, how docile she seemed. However, everything got explained nicely towards the end of the book.\\n\\nI was a bit worried that it would end with a cliffhanger, and yes, there was a kind of cliffhanger, but still the story felt ended at the moment. It's the kind of ending that felt satisfying and not frustrating. The previous books end was way more frustrating than this.\\n\\nFinally, I hope that Corrie is in the next book. She has not had a prominent role since White Fire book 13 and I loved that book and I adore her.\\n\\nI want to thank Grand Central Publishing for providing me with a free copy through NetGalley for an honest review!\"),\n",

That is why the men she uses to sate her lust are just a number and nothing more. That is, until she meets Dash.\\nDash leaves Willow craving more than just one night, but the rules they put in place make it seem unlikely that they will ever cross paths again.\\nHowever,  sometimes fate has other ideas.\\n\\nBOOK REVIEW:\\n\\nFifi Flowers novel, Just a Number, is an enjoyable read and really shows Fifis ability to see with an artistic eye things that the majority of us would fail to acknowledge.\\n\\nWritten in a dual point of view format, the romantic story is good, but it is the deeper elements that really make it work.\\nWillows relationship with her father has driven her to become independent and successful, but her mothers emails give her an insight on why her relationship with her parents was difficult.  Through the emails and Willows responses to them, the author allows her readers to see how Willow is awakened to a new perspective, and, although her ambitions and choices remain the same, she is not as rigid in her focus and suddenly sees a different side to life and people.  Dash, in comparison, is also very business driven, and has used his yoga enhanced love muscle to his libidos content, but his past has given him a wider outlook on life as well as the patience to allow others to sort through their difficulties and to give support when it is needed.\\n\\nAs characters I think they are well balanced and realistic and I found myself very impatient to see them finally unite and admit the feelings they had.\\n\\nFifis writing style has an artistic edge to it. She uses words that enhance the story for the reader and is able to build the characters so they are multifaceted. I found that I was frustrated by the lack of dialogue in the earlier parts of Dash and Willows relationship, but believe the author was using this to demonstrate the resistance of the main characters to develop a bond with each other.  However, it did make some parts feel a little forced to me, as though they were added to have some time away from the bedroom and up the word count. It took me a bit of time to appreciate the authors inventive idea of limiting their dialogue.\\n\\nJust A Number is a book worth reading if you want a different type of romance, but still want the naughty bits. There are some wonderfully sexy yoga scenes that will make even the most exercise resistant person want to find a yoga partner to practice with.\\n It is easy to read and the subtle story of Willows mother and father is very well thought out and gives the story that little bit more.\\n\\nReviewed by Iva Reads and rated 3.5 stars'),\n",

Desperate to avoid being forced into a marriage she doesnt want, Adeline (Adel) Hays ends up marrying Edmond Rochester, the Duke of Wolverton.  Edmonds tragic history has caused him to wall off his heart, and Adels wholehearted affection for his children and refusal to accept his strictures threatens to upend his world, but there are certain things even his power has no control over so he refuses to bendand Adel won\\'t be able to convince him to act differently.  Or will she?\\n\\nThis entertaining historical romance addresses several issues of the time, including the lack of choice facing daughters who are at the mercy of their parents decisions, the power inequity of different classes, and the dangers of childbirth.  I love the way Adel refuses to be forced into the box that others choose for her, and even though the initial results are not what she wants, she finds a way to cope.  The gradual evolution of her relationship with Edmond and the emotional revelations that take her so much time and effort to uncover are compelling to watch and I was definitely rooting for her.\\n\\nThere were a few awkward moments for me, including the oddness of her so-called friend Evies actions whose unrequited relationship with Edmonds friend the Marquess of Westfall wasn\\'t established sufficiently to explain her reasoning and I wanted to know what Edmond did to Lord Vale.

Why does it matter?  Anything goes.  This is an enjoyable, fun filled read.  I was sent this book for my review.  A rough, tough, gruff book filled with strange characters who will do anything to get revenge, get ahead of the game, or just to do what shouldn't be done, money matters much. I enjoyed visiting the many venues, night clubs, hotels, restaurants, the very wealthy classy venues, low class dives, characters representing themselves as who they are not.  Characters from many different places, Vegas is so  much different from their home towns.\\n\\nRandy Leeds, CEO and billionaire of ECco Green Pharmaceutical, brutal and cruel toward women, who can never have enough wealth  and will kill those who attempt to make his secrets public.  Tiny, three foot tall, Sparkle, Elvis dresser loves the ladies and they love him back.  He is so cute.  A nerdy scientist accuses the Eco Green Company of manufacturing a drug called ZeeFil for the common cold that would cause and kill millions with cancer.  Jimmy Dot, who wears orange clothes in all different orange shades, in spite of his tough exterior and swagger is a good guy who loves his beautiful wife who is six feet six inches tall who loves him as much as he loves her..  There are more interesting, colorful characters.  There are so many wonderful clubs, restaurants, hotels to visit in this book.  I have been to  the wild city of Vegas.

For example, this quote: Keith Oakley was not the kind of man who had art because he appreciated it. He was the kind of man who had art because it appreciated. From there, the rest of the novel just got better and better.\\n\\nAmory Vaughn, raised to take over his parents philanthropic endowment, is wealthy, spoiled, clever, and the epitome of social manners. My path had been laid long before I was born, and my only job now was not to trip as I put one handsomely-shod foot in front of the other. My parents were kind people, but I knew they viewed their work as noblesse oblige rather than a project of passion.\\n\\nHes also a romantic, longing for love, imagining an ideal mate. No matter how far apart on the grounds we drifted, the connection between us thrumming like a plucked harp string, vibrating us back together.\\n\\nAt a boring function, Vaughn notices socially awkward William Fox, watching him hungrily, as an erotic object, not a money bag. Vaughn pursues Fox, resulting in an explosively risqu encounter in front of a painting theyve admired.\\n\\nTo make an impression, Vaughn steals the painting, leaving it in front of Foxs apartment with an invitation to dinner. Can you see why I was hooked when the first chapter ended with Fox sulking, Now I had to arrest Amory Vaughn. Only in the next chapter do we learn Fox works for the FBIs Art Crimes Division.\\n\\nAnd when Fox and Vaughn eventually date, the dour, honest, astute, meticulously self-sufficient, but sensually inventive Fox begs, I need you to not bewho you areI need this to not be a terrible joke where Im a cop and you're a robber.\\n\\nI was delighted to be introduced to new phrases. Catholic preferences, means an appreciation of variety. A susurrus of leaves sounds just like what it means.\\n\\nBut Gale and Parrishs parlance also made me guffaw. These are not eggs, William. These are a nightmare that chickens have.\\n\\nThey made me sigh. William wanting me was one thing. William wanting me to have him? That was everything.\\n\\nAnd they surprised me, conveying experiences Ive never been able to put into language. The words lodged in my throat like too many people through the same doorway.\\n\\nAmory and Vaughns characters remain true, the two men circling each other, captivated by their differences, changing reluctantly. Only Vaughn could hear me say yard sale and respond as if they were the same as estate sales. Yet the couple is sufficiently wise to fear whether they can bridge their dissonant cultures, ethics, and points of view.\\n\\nGale and Parrish foreshadow the couples conflicts with such care, I found myself cringing, imaging when and where their inevitable showdown would occur, as if a ghoul with a machete was about to materialize. The reality was far subtler and more profoundly revealing than I could have guessed. Ive rarely read a plot as vibrant.\\n\\nReaders are treated to a thorough exploration of manipulation as part and parcel of bonding. Is manipulation inherently evil, since we can maneuver to make others happy, as easily as to vanquish competitors? Does control affect trust differently in love than in business?\\n\\nReaders receive brilliant philosophical contrasts between absolutists (people who believe ethics are clear-cut) and relativists (those who believe we should factor circumstance into moral decisions.) Perhaps I overreach in noting that Heart of the Steal sounds a bit too much like Trumps The Art of the Deal.\\n\\nLately, with polarized families torn asunder, I wonder if Gale and Parrish were suggesting how this country might be able to find common ground. Heart of the Steal certainly offers a cathartic alternative. Sometimes we have to bend a little bit-compromise what we think we know-for love.\\n\\nSo, lets summarize. Learned new words, check. Laughed a lot, check. Charmed by characters, check. Excited by the plot, check. Left to ponder my own values, check. A sparkling five stars to Gale and Parrish, and my deepest thanks.\"),\n",

       "   'It\\'s post-Prohibition in Twisted Tree, Kentucky. William McFee, an aspiring journalist, is feeling a little stagnant with his writing lately and is just itching to get to work rebooting the McFee family\\'s distillery business. William\\'s father, Barley, doesn\\'t exactly share his eldest son\\'s level of enthusiasm, but still allows William to go forward with the reboot to see what might come of it. All William is certain of is that the family desperately needs a new, healthier direction to move toward.\\n\\nBarley is tough on William, referring to him as \"a daisy\" (a sentiment echoed by William\\'s brother, Johnny) -- weak-natured, prone to panic attacks, preferring to read in the woods rather than hunt. But William doesn\\'t exactly see his father as a role model. Quite the opposite, though he still holds out hope for his father to come around. Already emotionally strained with the difficulties that come along with raising William\\'s physically disabled younger sister, Annie, Barley was left a shell of a man after the death of his son, Henry, from a car crash. Barley was driving the car with Henry as a passenger. Since that day, Barley has largely formed himself into a severely emotionally damaged alcoholic, hesitant to pull himself away from the safe space of his living room recliner. William is forced to watch as over time his parents slowly grow apart and his bonds with his siblings suffer cracks. It\\'s not the life he wants for his family. Before long, just one seemingly insignificant act brings proves to be the impetus that brings about the new life William so desperately craves.\\n\\nBehind the family\\'s distillery lies what\\'s known as a \"potter\\'s field\", a place where poor or homeless deceased with little or no family to claim them can be laid to rest. One such soul is brought to the McFee place. Shortly after the burial is completed, a band of twelve indigent people show up and set up nightly vigils around the plot, even squatting in a portion of the McFee\\'s bourbon rackhouse. These travellers claim that they were followers of the man buried in that grave, a man known as Asher Keating, whom they believed may have actually been the second coming of Christ. William is skeptical. That is, until he sees that his sister Annie\\'s legs seem to naturally free themselves of their crippled state with no immediate explanation. He then starts to suspect that this Asher Keating might have had a connection to the death of William\\'s brother, Henry.\\n\\nSoon word travels of the site, bringing more and more people wanting to pray over the grave, needing a miracle. Keating gets dubbed the \"Potter\\'s Field Christ\". One priest who visits the location even later claims he experienced stigmata upon returning to his church. Once the newspapers start writing of the wonders going on out at the McFee place, patriarch Barley starts to fear the media coverage will begin to swing light on the less noble, long buried secrets of the family\\'s past. When Barley and William decide to team up and travel around to discover what the real story behind Asher Keating was, they discover that even he might have had secrets of his own. They hear plenty tales of Asher using only the laying of his hands on someone to heal depression, consumption (tuberculosis), even blindness. But then there are also accounts of Asher himself battling drug addiction, or even possibly being mentally unhinged or delusional. The McFee men aren\\'t sure what to think, but they can\\'t deny that the lives of so many seem to be changing for the better. It leaves the reader to ponder on the idea that it\\'s not one\\'s past that has to define a soul, only what their heart\\'s true, pure intent is in the here and now. Mistakes of youth or demons of the mind don\\'t have to add up to a life sentence of misery. Every new day presents an opportunity for a clean slate! A realization that comes to Barley almost too late in life, but even he makes his final moments count.\\n\\nPersonally, I was so pumped to dive into this story. My fella and I travel around the South visiting distilleries as a mutual hobby of ours and I\\'m well acquainted with the area where this story takes place. Though the town of Twisted Tree itself is ficitonal, there is a brief shout-out given to the very real, very charming town of Bardstown, KY! A beautiful, quaint place to walk around, if you\\'re ever in the area. So yes, right out the gate I would recommend this as a fun read for all the bourbon / whiskey connoisseurs out there.\\n\\nIf you do not consider yourself such, your enjoyment of this story may depend on your sensitivity level as a reader. Though some scenes of violence are depicted, I didn\\'t find much in the way of overtly graphic material in the novel. However, it does touch upon some sensitive topics such as alcoholism, rum-running (bootlegging booze), racism and the KKK, and dealings with the Irish Mob. If this kind of material is of concern to you, you may want to tread carefully and see how you do. Otherwise, The Angels\\' Share is a quite enjoyable piece of historical fiction with a unique theme that doesn\\'t come up in a ton of novels -- the inner workings of the business of distilling spirits, even the buildings themselves! {I can tell you from experience, standing inside a rackroom, taking in that dusty quiet while you look up at towers of barrels brewing is truly an experience of wonder!} Author James Markert infuses a healthy dose of slang from the era, which gives the whole work a fun, authentic feel that helps immerse the reader into that post-Prohibition time period.\\n\\nI also highly recommend reading the author\\'s historical note provided after the close of the novel. Seeing as how the novel is entitled The Angels\\' Share, I was curious if Markert would likewise mention the flip side of that, what is known as the Devil\\'s Cut. While \"angel\\'s share\" is explained within the story of the McFees, \"devil\\'s cut\" is not worked into the novel itself, at least not in the traditional sense. Markert explains that there is a scene within the story that is inspired by the idea of the \"devil\\'s cut\", but he puts his own unique spin on it. For readers interested in the true history behind the terms, he does provide that in this historical note, along with some notes on \"The Golden Age\" when, as he says, \"there were more bourbon barrels aging in Kentucky than people.\" :-)\\n\\nFTC Disclaimer: In the case of this title, both TNZ Fiction Guild and BookLookBloggers kindly provided me with complimentary copies of this book with a request that I might check it out and share my thoughts.

In order to keep men from trying to hit on her, she wears a fake engagement ring, as it doesn't hurt because she has a successful match making business that she would like to keep growing, because being single isn't helpful advertisement.  Max Sterling is her realtor, and too hot for his own good.  She has a strong attraction to him, but won't ever act on it as she believes he could do better than her.  Max finds out the truth of her Faking It, and he realizes they could help each other out by keeping it going.  I tried and tried to keep it as generic as possible because I didn't want to give anything away.  The dynamic duo of Carly Phillips and Erika Wilde have done it again with an awesome story, as I devoured it in a matter of hours.  There is well placed humor, and a look at a couple that I dearly love as well.  Not to mention that the sexy scene goodness is STEAMY enough that all eye glasses will become fogged up.  My one complaint was that it was too short, because I NEED MORE OF MAX AND HAILEY!  At any rate, cannot wait for the next book in the series, and I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\"),\n",

This story is told by Taja, from middle grade to high school, as she searches for who she really is and what she really believes. The book seems to take place around the early 90s but we are never told this. Tajas African American parents live their life around their faith and want to instil that in their childrens lives. The parents do have a different set of rules for their son vs their daughters which causes conflict and frustration in Taja. As Taja grows older she begins to have some questions about her faith and how it works in her everyday life. A lot of the time Taja had no one to confide in as she struggled through these teenage years and I found myself sad for her. Overall though she finds out who she really is and is ready and excited for the next chapter in her life as she heads to college. I think Taja is going to turn out to be a pretty remarkable person as she goes on her journey. This book told a very nice story about moving through adolescence.'),\n",

Linking the murder to a missing hoard of cash, Schag cant believe his former colleague is responsible, but the evidence says otherwise. Caught in the middle of a conspiracy at the highest level, getting to the truth seems impossible. Can Schag untangle this web of corruption and clear Butchers name?\\n\\nThis is the second book in the Linus Schag, NCIS Thriller series by Martin Roy Hill. Though I hadnt read the first one, it works well as a stand alone and had me gripped from the first chapter. Hills attention to detail is admirable, and while at times it felt perhaps a little too detailed (and a little distracting), this didn't undermine the story. The writing is sharp and witty, with well-drawn characters and believable plot. Given Mr Hills work record as a journalist, as well as experiences in the Navy Reserves and California National Guard, its also one of those books that had me wondering how much is based on fact, such as the plot-line around the militarys use of anti-malaria drugs. If this stuff is true, its pretty scary and if its not, its a great story.\\n\\nAn all-round good read thatll keep you hooked until the last page.\"),\n",

Jack proposed marriage before they left, but with Alice things never go as planned.\\n\\nWhen Jack, Alice, and Lady, their enormous dog, arrive in Florida the community is bedeviled by a series of thefts. Nothing of serious value has been taken, although the prologue hints at something darker. The residents are concerned and have formed a committee to catch the thief, known as the Orange Blossom Cove Bandit. Laura, Jacks mother is so proud of him she told the committee that he will help solve the mystery. This generous offer leads to unforeseen complications.\\n\\nJacks parents, Laura and Ted, are impressive characters. They love each other and are very proud of their son. Theyre also involved with the community and enjoy their amusing neighbors. The retirement community is peopled by a series of zany seniors. They are stereotypical of what people think of as elders, but they're fun and add a light touch to the novel.\\n\\nThe romance between Alice and Jack seems destined to go on forever as a never completed action. However, this book may surprise you. The atmosphere of love and caring surrounding Jacks parents opens the door for a rather different ending.\\n\\nI enjoyed the book. The pace is fast; the retirement community scenes, well done; and the plot is full of twists. If you like Jack Stratton mysteries, this is one of the best.

       "   'When I began reading Bill Beverlys Dodgers I was expecting a story somewhere along the lines of the popular HBO series The Wire, a television series that captured my imagination for several years running.  And early on, the Dodgers plotline involving inner city (Los Angeles this time, instead of Baltimore) kids working for an older, ruthless drug lord did very much resemble The Wire.  But all of that changed when fifteen-year-old East, his younger brother, and two other young blacks set out on a road trip to Wisconsin, of all places, to kill a key witness who is prepared to testify against their boss in an upcoming trial.  Suddenly, I was reading one of the strangest coming-of-age novels I have ever run across.\\n\\nEast is one of the most street-savvy kids in his world.  At fifteen, he is already running a crew and is in charge of his own house, one of several drug dens his boss runs in their South Central Los Angeles neighborhood.  Even though he no longer lives at home, much preferring the privacy of sleeping in an abandoned building to sleeping in his old bedroom, East feels responsible for his drug-addled mother and provides her with enough money to survive  even though he knows where most of his cash goes.\\n\\nBut Wisconsin may as well be located in a foreign country for all East knows about it, so when he learns that the two older boys in the minivan with him and his brother have seen more of the world than just Los Angeles he is willing to sit back in the middle row of seats and enjoy the view he sees out the side windows.  And for a few hundred miles, and a few hours, all goes well.  Then personalities begin to clash, the expense money in their pockets begins to tempt one or two of the boys to behave rashly, and it starts to look like they will be arrested long before they reach Wisconsin where their target awaits them.\\n\\nEach of the boys in the minivan has been chosen because of a particular skill they have that will contribute to the success of their mission.  But, as East soon recognizes, the strength of the overall team turns out to be far less than the sum of its individual parts  and that places all of them, and their mission, in grave jeopardy unless someone steps in to make drastic changes.  Is East the man to make those changes?  Does he even want the job anymore, or has he been so changed by what hes experienced in his travels that now he wants more from life than the likelihood of an early death or decades spent behind prison bars?  Even East cant answer that one  yet.\\n\\nBill Beverlys novel is a beautifully written one filled with memorable characters caught up in a situation well beyond what any of them have ever experienced in their short lives.  Dodgers is, in fact, a remarkable debut that clearly marks Beverly as someone to watch for in 2017.  It is that good.\\n\\n(Review Copy provided by Publisher)'),\n",

       "   'Outside of a month I spent at Ft. Knox in 2004 and watching the entire run of \"Justified\" I don\\'t know much about Kentucky.  From my position of (admitted) ignorance, Deering\\'s portrait of a rural Kentucky barely-town seemed vivid in its verisimilitude.\\n\\nFor those of you (like me) who despise trying to decode attempts at transcribing dialects (think Jar Jar Binks: \"Meesa no habba da boomba\") you\\'ll be pleased to know that all the Kentucky twang is reflected in syntax and word choice.  For instance, one character said something like \"kindly go down to the gettin\\' store\" which is perfectly charming and evocative, especially when it could\\'ve been \"kinely git down to da gittin\\' stoh\" or some other such nonsense Faulkner would\\'ve made me wade through.\\n\\nBeyond the dialogue, Deering has an elegant way with prose, painting vivid portraits with a severe economy of word choice.  I\\'m kind of shocked that someone with a background in a visual medium like comic books is capable of this, but perhaps I\\'ve misunderstood the tools required for writing comics.  As a contemporary crafter of prose I can only compare Deering to Kimberly G. Giarratano, who up until now I had considered without peer.\\n\\nNow to the meat of the story, so to speak.  Kevin Brooks is a veteran returning from Afghanistan to the aforementioned barely-there Kentucky town.  He quickly learns how terrible dealing with the VA is (which rang true) and when he is told he is addicted to the drugs the Army ordered him to take - an all too real, all too common catch-22 situation - he tells off his doctor and stops taking his pills.  For the rest of the book, Kevin is haunted by dark dreams and a creature which may be a real monster or may simply be the product of his untreated PTSD.\\n\\nI was diagnosed with PTSD, which is not something that I like to talk about, but it\\'s not exactly secret either.  Deering\\'s portrait of someone being haunted by something, just out of the corner of the eye, seemed sharp to me.  And I particularly appreciated the explanation of the titular term \"husk\" - well, one interpretation of it, anyway - as one of my personal symptoms is a \"flat affect.\"\\n\\nI was not so impressed with the (admittedly brief) depiction of Kevin\\'s time in Afghanistan.  I always feel like a broken record complaining about this sort of thing, and maybe I should just stop reading books about the military with such a critical eye, but there were things like Kevin calling an NCO \"sir\" and Afghanistan \"the sandbox\" (and implying that it was a desert country) or that, as a wrecker driver he had killed twenty guys, I dunno, it just took me out of the story.  And then the platoon sergeant was ordering around Bravo 16, which would\\'ve been his boss, and then they were calling one vehicle \"Bravo 16\" and the other one just \"Wrench\" instead of \"Brave Wrench\"...I should probably stop now.  It\\'s a shame, though, because considering the care that went into the exploration of psychology, the charming love story, and the rural Kentucky background, a little more work on the first chapter could\\'ve made this novella flawless from start to finish.\\n\\nIn any case, if you\\'re not an impossible-to-please vet like myself, you can probably just ignore that entire last paragraph.  HUSK is, regardless of small flaws, a chilling, haunting novella, and as a prose debut I think it signals quite a career to come for Rachel Autumn Deering.'),\n",

       "   \"As DEATH BELOW STAIRS opens, Mrs. Kat Holloway has just accepted the position of cook in the household of Lady Rankin.  She meets the other staff members and appears to ease seamlessly into her new job.  Any thoughts she may have had about a tranquil existence are quickly shattered, as her young assistant, Sinead, is found murdered the very next day.  The volatile Lord Rankin threatens to sack her, and the household is in chaos.  Onto the scene, comes Daniel McAdam, a mysterious man who has a history with Kat.\\n\\nDaniel is a chameleon - he can take on the guise of a lowly servant, as well as a finely dressed gentleman.  He is fond of Kat, and we learn through her recollections that they have shared a kiss or two, though she has been unable to get a straight answer from him as to who exactly he works for.  He does advise Kat that there are suspicions about the new household she's working in, and he advises her to take caution as she may be in danger.\\n\\nKat is a no-nonsense type of woman, though she has a kind nature.  She is abrupt with Daniel, but it's apparent she has a definite soft spot for him.  Kat learned some bitter lessons from her deceased husband, and she's leery of romantic relationships.  She has a young daughter, Grace, who lives with two good friends while Kat works to support her.  Daniel also has a child, a son James, who appears to have inherited his father's cleverness and charm.\\n\\nIt's soon revealed that the murder of Sinead is only a small part of a much larger plot, one that ambitiously seeks to assassinate Queen Victoria.  At this point, the reader has to just go with the flow of this entertaining story, and not expect that it resembles reality.  It's very unlikely that a newly hired cook would have the latitude to leave her position in order to run out whenever the need arises, in order to meet Daniel or to take part in some aspect of investigating this treasonous plot.  It's even more unlikely that she could take off for longer than a day, and have Daniel install a temporary cook in her place.\\n\\nI very much enjoyed DEATH BELOW STAIRS, and its main characters.  Daniel has the type of charm that is genuine, and he is obviously fond of Kat, and is a very capable man.  Kat is cautious and good hearted, and a dedicated parent.  While the romance takes a backseat to the mystery, it is definitely there at a slow simmer.  The story is all told in first person, and Kat's point of view often includes an inordinate amount of information about food and its preparation.  While Kat's thoughts fill in some of the puzzle pieces of her past with Daniel, I still felt that I should have more information.  I later found out that there is a novella prequel to this story, titled A SOUPCON OF POISON, which I intend to read.  The writing of DEATH BELOW STAIRS felt very different from the Jennifer Ashley historical romances, though equally as captivating.  If you enjoy a well written and entertaining mystery with a touch of romance, I recommend DEATH BELOW STAIRS, but I strongly urge reading the prequel first.\\n\\nAs reviewed at rosesareblue dot net.  I received a complimentary copy of this book.\"),\n",

I was intrigued by the extensive amount of information that was included on plant based contraceptives that were used in the past.

Another theme I avoid is Lizzy married to Collins. I confess to have just skimmed over those parts which were mostly told in flashbacks since the personage was dead at the start of the book. Still he seems to hover overhead, his memory infecting the present and the possibility of the future.\\n\\nThe sexual aspects were well-handled and necessary to the plot. Speaking of the plot, it was original and very well executed. Lizzy was thoroughly scarred by an abusive marriage (sexually, emotionally, and physically) and she's too traumatized to consider leaving the cocoon of an unfulfilling but safe & lonely life--even when she realizes she loves Darcy. But, because she loves him, she wants to at least try to overcome her fears for his sake, thus the idea of a trial relationship without marriage.\\n\\nThe Bennet family dynamics and the effect of the Collins experience scars not only Lizzy but Kitty as well. Mrs. Bennet, as usual, just makes matters worse. Both Lizzy and Darcy are portrayed beautifully, but Darcy, is more sensitive and understanding than I've seen him portrayed before. He instinctively understands Lizzy's fragility and they both put each other's feelings ahead of their own. The results are beautiful to behold.\"),\n",

The story advances not  at all. Rick kills a few things in a few caves, gets drunk, and bangs an elf. Entire book in one sentence. Then there is the length. 397 pages. Cut 10 for the nonsense at the beginning. Another 40 for the appendix. Likely another 50 for all the copy/paste 'so and so leveled up such and such.' /paste dialogue that has been displayed 100 times throughout the series.

(Spoilers)\\n\\nThis book had a lot of potential, rich with complex relationships that mimic the darker side of reality. As you read, you become more and more sympathetic for Mary and the constant line of struggles she suffers trying to keep her baby. Eventually you begin to wonder where her break is as her court case against her mother takes off, but she loses boyfriend Ted and gets beaten by her juvenile roommates. Her one friend in the boarding house quite suddenly turns out to be crazy and evil, with little to no indication or foreshadowing of the fact. The end is much like this, tossing aside all of the buildup of stories about the abuse from Mary's mother to say that Mary lied the entire time to get away from her mother and replace deceased baby Alyssa in the Richardson family. Again there was little to no indication through out the book to this ending, so much so that it seemed to go entirely against the book. She went from a resolution that had her being sympathetic to her mom even though she had been used and betrayed, trying to drop the case as she realized her mother would die in the system, to suddenly being morbidly happy that her mom could go to jail and she was free from her with Mrs. Richardson as her new mom. Her tone also does a complete 180, taking on a random childish voice that we never saw in the first 17 chapters. This book could have been amazing, but seriously flopped at the ending with a cheap twist. Very disappointed.\"),\n",

       "   'Firstly, I have to say that I have adored almost all of Lisa Marie Rice\\'s novels, and especially all of the Midnight series and I did enjoy the story of Nick and Kay, but there were significant issues for me.  The story is of Kay, scientific researcher, and new ASI employee Nick - she has been avoiding him for months while he pursued her in an effort to protect him from a bio weapon plot she has become embroiled in. Nick and Kay were somewhat typical leads, the bad guy a typical bad guy. My issue is that I found it hard to believe it is the same writer that wrote Midnight Man etc who wrote this story. For one, the storyline of bio weapon - hitman for murder - government contract corruption - was less well written , appeared less knowledgeable and researched than those in previous novels. The writing itself was far more basic, less descriptive and common , ie using the word \" scruffy\" when in previous novels it would have been \"unkempt\" or something similar. The characterisation was far less complex and Kay especially was unlike her previous female leads - she is far coarser (joking about hoping the female assistants for Isabelle got laid), she swears and she is far more forward sexually and in general, not as appealing as those characters such as Suzanne, Lauren, Isabelle, who were nicer. Kay is especially unappealing in the scene where she is describing why her deceased best friend would not have gone out with a colleague, saying he would need plastic surgery before he should have had the gall to ask her beautiful friend out - it shows her in an unpleasantly shallow, arrogant and judgemental light, when she could have just concentrated on how  unpleasant he was as a person. Nick was more likable for me, but he seemed a little less naturally alpha than previous male leads.  The storyline was good but could have been better written and was a little less satisfying, but it was great to see glimpses of beloved characters from other Midnight novels. Worth a read, just not as great as her others. If it is a new author writing under the same pen name, more care should have been taken to match the tone, complexity and characterisation in her other novels so fans would not be disappointed.'),\n",

Since I hadnt read that book, I cant say if any material has been added or deleted from the original work.\\n\\nRevenge is a series of 3 stories following the McKee family of Rimrock Oregon. The patriarch, Jonah McKee was a domineering controlling chauvinist with an unsavory reputation. After Jonahs death, his children discover how he had manipulated their lives since birth, and now each child comes to terms with the situations and their lives.\\n\\nOverall I felt like the book would make a great Hallmark movie, the domineering patriarch, excessive family wealth, control of the town, land grabs, gossip, relationship challenges, blackmail, backstabbing and more. I had to remind myself that the story was written well over 16 years ago, and it reflects many of the issues and attitudes of those years. There is a touch of mystery in the story, but overall it a romantic drama fest. I also want to note that I would probably watch this if it were on Hallmark.\\n\\nThe writing is fine, the character building is fine, the interconnection between the three stories was also done well, but the stories are just mediocre, nothing special in my opinion. I feel that this book shows not only how times and attitudes have changed, but how the author has improved in her writing, now creating some outstanding stories that keep the reader on the edge of their seat. If this were my first Lisa Jackson book, I would not have her on my must read list.\\n\\nI wish to thank Kensington Books, Zebra, for the advanced copy of the book, as well as Netgalley for providing the opportunity for an honest review. The book is lengthy, and the review copy was only provided in secure PDF format, which for me limited where I could read and when I could read it.

Yesterday, at the Books Inc Store, Berkeley, I attended the authors lively presentation. She answered audience questions with precise knowledge, concision, and grace.\\n\\n THE NORDIC THEORY OF EVERYTHING: In Search of a Better Life,\" documented with more than 400 research citations and written in highly engaging style  is an excellent example of lucid critical analysis.\\n\\nThe widely held stereotype in the US of Nordic countries is that they are nanny states that discourage individuality and impose high taxes. In fact, the Nordic countries foster enhanced adult individuality by minimizing dependencies on family members and employers. And their Nordic countries\\' taxes are comparable to the US taxes. Just how they accomplish is convincingly detailed in the book.\\n\\nThe subtitle In Search of a Better Life accurately describes the authors view-point and tone. An immigrant to the US who arrived from Finland eight years ago, now in love with the country of her adoption, she is also proud of her heritage. Rightly so, the Nordic countries have been consistently top-ranked as the happiest. The US is not even in the top ten.\\n\\nPartanen offers suggestions based on the The Nordic Theory of Love (Chapter 2): for better Family Values for Real\" (Chapter 3); for children Attaining Educational Success (Chapter 4); for better health care How Universal Health Care Could Set You Free (Chapter 5). The titles and subtitles of the next four chapters are also equally apt: Ask What Your Country Can Do for You; Bringing Back the American Dream; Business as Unusual: How to Run a Company in the Twenty-First Century; The Pursuit of Happiness: Its Time to Rethink Success.\\n\\nRecently, I posted an update of my review of the earlier edition of the most widely adopted college textbook in the US: Diane Hacker and Nancy Sumners A Writers Reference: Eighth Edition. Anu Partenens THE NORDIC THEORY OF EVERYTHING: In Search of a Better Life merits just as wide adoption for all college students. Not only for college students, I whole-heartedly recommend this book to all readers.\\n\\n (May I add that\\nafter having posted reviews of more than 120 books on amazon.com, this is the first that I recommend as a \"must-read.\") --  C J Singh\\n-------------'),\n",

It's a novel premise about a possible upcoming epidemic that has been created by the use of new technology. The safety of future generations affected by the technological cancer, both medical and spiritual, is at stake. Genesis Girl's storyline examines the hold that technology has on the characters lives and, in turn, on the readers life. It was hard for me not to think about creating more balance in my life. I remember before people had online lives and cell phones, when you could leave the house and be entirely unreachable and how that provided freedom and autonomy. The story made me aware of how often I feel the need to check my email, texts or Facebook page. At what cost do we all stay connected...and therein lies the rub...and therein lies Genesis Girl. Magically drawn characters inhabit the pages and the story flows along quickly drawing in the reader and effortlessly creating the mirror at which we can examine our own digital life. While Bardsley is building a strong case for purity (I was completely sucked in) she is setting up a wonderful surprise for the reader at the end.

       "   \"The sheer quality of the writing deserves five stars, but I have ungenerously given the book only four, because of what I would call its extremely reductive rendering of human possibilities. The title, of course, could mean 'the abundance that man is capable of' or 'the puny limit of human potential'; and it's very much the latter sense that applies here. The nine stories that make up this 'novel' are thematically linked in their pitiless portrayal of lives that have no meaning, of characters that are left wondering 'Is this all there is to life?' All the characters are men, ranging in age from about seventeen to seventy-three, and ranging in temperament from coldly selfish to existentially terrified. Sorry, I know that's vague, but I'm not going to provide potted summaries of nine stories. One could, though, generalize about what they don't have: there is no humour, almost no human warmth (the only exception I can think of is in the last story, the affection an elderly repressed homosexual feels for his daughter), no love (again with that one exception), no friendship, with people spending time with each other only because being on their own would be worse. The author has an impressive command of places in Europe one would not necessarily want to visit, and he does not spare us the details, almost without exception bleak. Cyprus in particular would seem to be best avoided as a holiday destination, with Croatia a close second. And don't go skiing in France. All the characters travel, and the keynote here is struck by the young man in the first story who exasperates his travelling companion by constantly wondering aloud why one would want to travel. Certainly nothing in the remaining eight stories provides an answer to that one.\\nSo why did I not stop reading after the first story? Well, a bit like Houellebecq, the sheer dreadfulness exerts a kind of fascination :  can things really be this awful? And can it get any worse? (It does: there is a scene in a Chinese restaurant in Croatia that still makes me feel ill.)\\nAnd then, yes, the writing is truly brilliant. Only a consummate writer could come up with such an infinite variety of morbid states of mind. There is even something exhilarating about it.\"),\n",

The one night she decides to cut lose, she meets Max.  A lot of passion and dirty dancing happens but then fate slaps them in the face. Morgan and Max have to work together a lot.

I got immediately sucked into each story and the lives of all the characters. The overall arc that ties all three books together, the suspense plot of each individual book and the main romance in each book flows seamlessly throughout the entire book in this authors capable hands.\\nReunited with the P.I. is a second chance romantic suspense. I feel the trilogy does need to be read in order even with each book focusing on a different H/h and suspense plot because there is a strong overall plot arc between the three heroines and their pasts that is prevalent in each book.\\nSimone Armstrong is a driven Assistant District Attorney nicknamed The Avenging Angel due to the fact that she does not lose and she always wears all white. She is about to go to trial, when she is notified that the witness that her whole case is built on has disappeared. She no longer knows who she can trust in her office. She knows she has to get outside help from a private investigator and the one she wants has major problems with her. She helped put his brother in prison and he is her ex-husband.\\nVince Sutton is an ex-Marine, P.I. and now owns and runs his own sports bar and restaurant The Brass Eagle. The last person he expects to come to him with an appeal for help is his ex-wife. After the problems on his last case, he wants to tell her no, but she makes him a deal he cant refuse. Even with the three year separation, Vince has never gotten over Simone. As he and Simone get drawn further into her present case and he finds out about the threats from a cold case, he vows to protect her, whether she wants it or not.\\nSimone is as complex a heroine as Eden was in the first book. Simone is driven to put as many bad guys away as possible to make up for her past guilt that she still carries. She does not let anyone in because she is afraid they will be hurt and she does not know how to handle not being in complete control of any situation. Vince comes from an abusive background and also has to deal with what he saw during the war. These two were so realistically written and the author did a great job of bringing them back together at an authentic pace while keeping the suspense growing and the sexual tension high.\\nI am really looking forward to reading the finale to this trilogy.

When I first bought this book it was interesting enough but wasn't something I was so extremely excited for or a book I just couldn't wait for it. Though as it was released more and more people read it and said they loved it and I had heard nothing but good things so it got me really excited to read it.\\n\\nI want to start off by saying that Cora Carmack's writing is stunning, and I just fell in love with it every chapter I read! I had my notebook by my side a kept writing all these phrases and quotes because I thought they were so beautiful.\\nI think my favorite thing about this whole book was the world that Cora Carmack created. I thought it was so unique and I found the whole storm magic aspect extremely interesting. I think this was an extremely well built fantasy world. Something extra that she did that I thought added another layer this world was the literature, religion, poetry, etc. that was created specifically for The Land of Caelira and this book. Before each chapter we saw a quote from some form of literature from The Land of Caelira and that's definitely something that proves how much time and thought was put into world building for this book.\\n\\nI liked all of these characters well enough, but I didn't feel like I was connecting to them as much as I normally would have liked. This could have been partially because I read this book a bit slow because I was really busy. This should have been a quick read and I felt like I would have been a little more involved and connected if I read it in larger chunks. I do absolutely love Aurora and really felt for what she was going through and her stubbornness and passion. Cassius was another character that really interested me, but I didn't feel like we got to know him extremely well which made me kind of sad. This is the first in a series of books, so I'm hoping we get to go more in depth with more of these characters in future books.\\n\\nAt times the story did feel a little bit slow, and it's definitely not as action packed as other YA books. Though I was very involved with the story about a hundred pages from finishing. I think what we discover and what happens makes this all so much more exciting. It really left me anxious and wanting for the next book in the series!\\n\\nOverall this is an AMAZING YA book, with an incredible fantasy world! I'm so excited to read future books in this series and discover more about these characters and this story. I'd definitely recommend if you're looking to start a new fantasy series.\"),\n",

The sexy times are off the chain. There really is nothing you could ask for that is not included in this book. Anything from straight up M/F vanilla (somewhat vanilla anyway) sex to out right g*ng-b*ng style multiple partners at once. Straight, g*y, menage, multiple, partner switch, forced... its all included within the pages of this book. Which brings me to the issue I had. While I love good sexy times, and I probably love them more than most - I need a good solid story to go along with it. Confessions had a storyline, and it was ok - it was good. It was interesting and well written. It just wasn't (my opinion only) strong enough to go along with ALLLL the sex that was happening in the rest of the book.

The story line was not a new one and there were a couple of plot twists in the story that didn't seem necessary and just bewildered me, but for the most part it was a very good story.\\n\\nNiall aka the Beast, is the firstborn son of the Laird of Kincaid - his father and mother were murdered when two rival clans laid siege to the castle. Niall and his two brothers were taken away and separated. Seventeen years pass before Niall returns to his home. His plan is simple - he will reclaim his birthright and kill the people responsible for his parents murder. What he doesn't plan on is falling in love with his enemy's daughter.\\n\\nElspeth is the eldest daughter of the MacClaren (one of the two clan leaders that killed Niall's parents). They meet when Niall saves her and her youngest sister from drowning. Niall mistakes Elspeth for a maid and is attracted to her - when he finds out who she really is - he tries to keep his distance. Elspeth's father is very ill and is pushing her to marry - he needs her to make a good match to strengthen the clan. Elspeth knows she must do her duty and marry well - but after Niall rescues her yet again and they share a kiss - he is the one she wants, even though she knows she can't have him.\\n\\nWhat transpires from here is a push and pull game between these two would be lovers - he because he can't bear to hurt her and her because she knows her duty to her clan. In my opinion, this dragged on a little too long.\\n\\nAfter going to a clan gathering to find a potential husband and being attacked by a neighboring clan's son, Elspeth has come up with a plan - she will marry Niall, as he is able to protect her clan. After saving Elspeth yet again and knowing that the time to strike and get his vengeance is near - Niall makes one final attempt to push her away. When the offer to marry her is presented, he can't say no - even though he knows that when she finds out the truth, she will hate him.\\n\\nThey marry and immediately after the ceremony, Niall announces his true identity, claims the castle and takes Elspeth's family captive. Elspeth is heartbroken and can't believe her father guilty of the crimes Niall has accused him of. She is even more upset when she learns the truth.\\n\\nThe rest of the story wraps up fairly quickly, the two lovers reconcile and find some peace between them. Niall lets go of his vengeance for her and gets an unexpected surprise in return.\\n\\nThe author nicely sets up the next book without detracting from this story at all.

Our hero isn't the usual gorgeous and rich rake but a brilliant and darker man with a learning disability. It doesn't stop him from rising to the occasion to be everything that I wanted him to be. Our heroine took a little getting used to, but I think some of the other reviews don't do her justice.

       "   \"I love it whenever I choose a book to read with some reluctance and I find myself so engrossed in the reading that I cant put the book down (even if I have a lot of other things to do). This is one of those books. It surprised me from the beginning and kept my attention to the end. A real page turner, I must confess.\\nThe author turned a controversial subject into something more than one would expect. Yes, it is a thriller, and yes, I can say that there is some romance (maybe more than some) but the subject and narrative goes beyond that.\\nWhenever I am stressed I stay away from books with serious subjects  whats the point in getting more stressed? Well, don't worry. Even if you're stressed, youll forget everything about your problems while reading this book.\\nI cannot say I had a favorite character. I liked both male leading characters  Ben and Bill, and both leading female characters  Ebony and Rebecca. All of them are strong, and yet, each one of them has their quirks and fears, which make them more realistic. I felt a stronger connection with Ben, probably because he was the strongest of all of them. Becka and Ebony disappointed me with their actions in a certain moment, but that didn't deflect from their likability. We are human, so we are feeble.\\nMy least favorite character was Gabby  she is the typical woman who doesnt care for someone until someone else will have them. I always disliked such people and I disliked her. She has her role in the story though and not only in relation with Ben.\\nI think that Ebony had the most personal growth but I will not get into details  spoiler alert. However, Billy had the worst possible choice: his professional career or the possibility of looking at himself in the mirror without being ashamed with himself. I wouldnt have liked to have been in his shoes. Its easy to say youd have made the honest choice as long as you don't have to do it.\\nAt the beginning, I had a problem with the point of view. Each chapter presented the story as told in the first person by a character. At the time, I thought it would be very confusing. Yet, after the first three chapters, I realized that the point of view was extremely important. The story was stronger and had more impact exactly because it was narrated like that.\\nThis story showed me what I knew  people are very narrow-minded. It always angers me and it angered me during the reading as well. Yet, I liked the balance in the authors perception: nothing is white or black. Theres ugliness on both sides. Prejudices don't belong to one race or one community (unfortunately  they are global).\\nI consider this is a book worth reading. The writing style is very good. The author doesnt try to impress anyone. He just tells his story, from various points of view and gives the reader the possibility to choose, think and draw his/her conclusions. The narrative is clear, the characters are well defined, rounded, with a clear evolution. I do see this book made into a movie  its got everything: reality, crime, love, social situations etc.\\nI highly recommend this book. Believe me, there are a lot of good authors  their writing is flawless, the story is well written and interesting and the characters are likable. Yet, there are few authors that go beyond that. Ben Burgess Jr. is one of them.\"),\n",

       "   'Daniel Silva mines current and historical events in \"The Other Woman,\" an espionage novel in which he describes the growing threat that Vladimir Putin poses to his democratic adversaries. The story opens with the impending defection of Russian spy Konstantin Kirov, code-named Heathcliff. Unfortunately, someone leaks details of the exfiltration and it goes terribly wrong. Journalists and others lambaste Gabriel Allon--chief of Israel\\'s Secret Intelligence Service--who is stung by allegations that portray him as incompetent or even complicit in the blown operation. Subsequently, Allon and his team are determined to identify a mole who is passing classified information to Moscow.\\n\\nThis hefty work of fiction has a large cast; fascinating background about the Cambridge Five, citizens of the U. K. who embraced communism and transmitted state secrets to the Soviet Union; old-fashioned tradecraft (dead-drops, safe houses, and surreptitiously tailing of persons of interest); sophisticated surveillance involving high powered cameras and other sensitive eavesdropping equipment; games of cat and mouse that threaten to turn violent; and trips to such places as Austria, England, France Washington, D. C., Spain, and Canada. The plot is dizzying and, at times, difficult to follow, but the second half picks up steam, especially when Silva focuses on a confrontation between two wily and experienced spies.\\n\\nThe author depicts a shadowy world in which men and women betray their country for money, because of their political beliefs, and/or to boost their egos. Allon and company spare no effort or expense to fulfill their mission but, even with meticulous planning, not everything goes precisely as expected. To his credit, Silva offers no pat solutions to the bitter conflicts that make our divided world so dangerous. Moreover, he effectively portrays the precarious lives of intelligence agents who, in order to survive, must be convincing, resourceful, and audacious. \"The Other Woman\" has its flaws. It is too long and drawn-out, and there are instances of painfully clichd writing (\"Fear stalked him day and night.\" \"He was gripped by an overwhelming sense of impending doom.\"). On the other hand, the book becomes far more compelling when the seemingly disparate threads come together, and the proceedings conclude with a suspenseful, intense, and engrossing finale.'),\n",

This is not only a great love story but it's infused with humor and heat.  Kennedy Randolph and Brent Mason were childhood friends all the way up until the end of High School when they went their separate ways.  I don't want to give anything away but the parting was less than amicable.  14 years later they face each other as opposing attorneys in the courtroom and the battle begins, both personally and professionally.  The author skillfully takes us on a gut wrenching trip down memory lane where we find out what really happened to their friendship.  There's some emotional stuff here that adds some depth to this complicated relationship.  The HEA was epic and I loved the ending.  I was happy to see all the gang from the previous books, especially my main man Jake. Jake and his brood provide some laugh out loud moments as do the other characters, Stanton, Sofia, Chelsea and the parents.  So sad the series has ended.  Very bittersweet.\"),\n",

       "   \"Teitelman sets out to examine the roots of modern M&A, particularly in the '70s and '80s. He comes back with something deeper and, when you think about it,  highly relevant to our politically fraught times. At a time when tax-inversion deals and the export of jobs are being hotly debated, he has produced a highly readable account of how we developed our current  confusing and contradictory set of ideas about who runs, and who should run, the corporations that figure so prominently in our lives.\\n\\nThe narrative is chronological, but it's structured (mostly) as a series of profiles of major figures who shaped that era: Joe Flom, Marty Lipton, Felix Rohatyn, Harvard's Michael Jensen, Bruce Wasserstein, Michael Milken, Chancery Judge Bill Allen and Justice Drew Moore of Delaware. These were exciting times; and these were fascinating figures. There's a strong sociological element to these personal stories, particularly in the rise of a non-WASP, Jewish bar (led by Flom and Lipton) and a deregulated, more transactional and larger Wall Street. This produced a virulent anti-Semitism in the late '80s, and informs some of the recurrent anti-finance mood of today.\\n\\nBeneath the surface, however, unfold a series of tensions: the shift from stakeholder model to shareholders; the breakdown of managerial for shareholder or market prerogative; between long term and short, relationships and transactions, defense (the poison pill) and offense (junk bonds);  the tension between the states and the federal corporate law; and between an ideological conception of the  corporation and of M&A and a more empirical view of those matters.\\n\\nThese issues shape the vast disruption of the hostile takeover market, which was justified in terms of efficiency and competitiveness rather than the more traditional view of a balance of interestsworkers, customer, local, state and national.\\n\\nTeitelman does a fine job of untangling  the politics of all thisa politics of strange bedfellows indeed: union pension funds defending shareholder primacy and a takeover culture, which produced layoffs for their own workers; the  conservative, free market crowd attacking the rights of their natural allies, managers; the confused politics of state vs. federal primacy, which created a situation in which natural enemies found themselves supporting traditional state preeminence in corporate law, all the while sniping from both sides at Delaware decisions.\\n\\nTeitelman's argument isn't that the world M&A created is all good or all bad, but that it has grave political problemsin terms of corporate governance and particularly in terms of the larger political culture. M&A may be hot right now, but there are aspects of the systempolitical breakdown, regulatory cynicism, a vast accumulation of rulesthat leads one back to the period, the late '60s, just before stakeholdership began to collapse.

He now has a great job in Washington, his very own place for the first time and wants very much to experience life.

Only one problem.

Thomas won't/can't risk a relationship and initially comes off as somewhat arrogant and selfish. When we learn how well loved he is by his friends, you know that there is more to him than initial impression and Zachary comes to that realization as well.\\n\\nSecondary characters in this story,including the guys at the Mata Hari, are all likable and interesting, men mostly, who have created a 'family of friends'.

I loved the first book and as a reader I always worry the second book will not be good as the first and I was WRONG. In this book the heroine is Nikki that you met during the first book as she re enters town after fleeing when she found out that she is pregnant with Austins (also from the first book) child. Nikki and Austin both have major hang ups from their pasts that keep them from truly being open and honest with each other. Once Nikki comes back into town Austin is not sure what he wants besides being there for his child. Once Nikki and Austin are thrown together sparks fly but both are cautious. Add in someone is stealing and sabotaging Austins company creates a whole lot of drama. This was an amazing book that had me laughing and crying. I cant wait to read more of this series.'),\n",

They don't even need to embellish the story at all for it to be the biggest, best, and most inspiring Action Movie of All Time!  Gunn's war years literally read like a historical fiction novel with a love story, unbelievable one-man influence on some of WWII's seminal events (Philippines 1942, New Guinea 42-43, Bismarck Sea 1943, and Leyte Gulf), figures (General Kenney, Hap Arnold and Douglas MacArthur) the wartime aviation industry, unbelievable honest-to-God heroic stuff!
